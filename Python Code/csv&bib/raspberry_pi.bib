	abstract = {Given that next generation networks are expected to be populated by a large number of devices,there is a need for quick deployment and evaluation of alternative mechanisms to cope with the possible generated traffic in large-scale distributed data networks. In this sense,the Raspberry Pi has been a popular network node choice due to its reduced size,processing capabilities,low cost and its support by widely-used operating systems. For information transport,network coding is a new paradigm for fast and reliable data processing in networking and storage systems,which overcomes various limitations of state-of-the-art routing techniques. Therefore,in this work,we provide an in-depth performance evaluation of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC)-based schemes for the Raspberry Pi Models 1 and 2,by showing the processing speed of the encoding and decoding operations and the corresponding energy consumption. Our results show that,in several scenarios,processing speeds of more than 80 Mbps in the Raspberry Pi Model 1 and 800 Mbps in the Raspberry Pi Model 2 are attainable. Moreover,we show that the processing energy per bit for network coding is below 1 nJ or even an order of magnitude less in these scenarios. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI,Basel,Switzerland.},

Protomesh is a platform for starting up a quick ad-hoc batman-adv network. Batman-adv is an open source, kernel module native to Linux that provides a layer two mesh network routing protocol [2]. We leveraged this technology during Raspberry Pi workshops to use as a wireless infrastructure where students could freely access their Raspberry Pi across the mesh network. Network technologies such as this provide both an interactive and enriching experience. Protomesh enhances this experience by providing a solution for wireless connections and removing the burden of tethered Raspberry Pis. By allowing students to experience Raspberry Pi's wirelessly, students are enabled to explore a new horizon of embedded education. © 2017 IEEE.},

Compared to previous implementations that relied on a good network connection for good functionality, in my case the processing/detection will be done locally using a Raspberry Pi4 module, mounted on the drone. The first part of our research consisted of building a lightweight drone with some of the best racing components, chosen carefully for our specific needs. The second part consisted of implementing a computationally-low-cost detection algorithm on the Raspberry Pi, using convolutional neural networks and Tensorflow Lite. The chosen algorithm that was used was SSD-Single Shot Detection, capable of detecting multiple objects in one image during one iteration of the algorithm. I also designed an enclosure to securely place the drone battery, Raspberry Pi Battery and Raspberry Pi module on the drone, which was 3D printed.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The original aim when creating the Raspberry Pi was to encourage “kids”—pre-university learners—to engage with programming, and to develop an interest in and understanding of programming and computer science concepts. The method to achieve this was to give them their own, low cost computer that they could use to program on, as a replacement for a family PC that often did not allow this option. With the original release, the Raspberry Pi included two programming environments in the standard distribution software: Scratch and IDLE, a Python environment. In this paper, we describe two programming environments that we developed and recently ported and optimised for the Raspberry Pi, Greenfoot and BlueJ, both using the Java programming language. Greenfoot and BlueJ are both now included in the Raspberry Pi standard software distribution, and they differ in many respects from IDLE; they are more graphical, more interactive, more engaging, and illustrate concepts of object orientation more clearly. Thus, they have the potential to support the original aim of the Raspberry Pi by creating a deeper engagement with programming. This paper describes these two environments and how they may be used, and discusses their differences and relationships to the two previously available systems. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The field of biology has seen tremendous technological progress in recent years, fuelled by the exponential growth in processing power and high-level computing, and the rise of global information sharing. Low-cost single-board computers are predicted to be one of the key technological advancements to further revolutionise this field. So far, an overview of current uptake of these devices and a general guide to help researchers integrate them in their work has been missing. In this paper I focus on the most widely used single-board computer, the Raspberry Pi, and review its broad applications and uses across the biological domain. Since its release in 2012, the Raspberry Pi has been increasingly taken up by biologists, in the laboratory, the field and in the classroom, and across a wide range of disciplines. A hugely diverse range of applications exists that ranges from simple solutions to dedicated custom-build devices, including nest-box monitoring, wildlife camera trapping, high-throughput behavioural recording, large-scale plant phenotyping, underwater video surveillance, closed-loop operant learning experiments and autonomous ecosystem monitoring. Despite the breadth of its implementations, the depth of uptake of the Raspberry Pi by the scientific community is still limited. The broad capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, combined with its low cost, ease of use and large user community make it a great research tool for almost any project. To help accelerate the uptake of the Raspberry Pi by the scientific community, I provide detailed guidelines, recommendations and considerations, and 30+ step-by-step guides on a dedicated accompanying website (http://raspberrypi-guide.github.io). I hope this paper will help generate more awareness about the Raspberry Pi among scientists and thereby both fuel the democratisation of science and ultimately help advance our understanding of biology, from the micro- to the macro-scale. © 2021 The Authors.

When any motion is detected pi activate the webcam for capturing the image if anyone enters a wrong password or tries to enter a random password, at that time processor sends an email or SMS alert to register id or mobile number. When motion detected using passive infrared sensor (PIR) the raspberry pi store the image in the cloud using the SMTP mail server and send them to register email. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach: An OBD-II scanner plugged into the OBD-II port or usually called the data link connector (DLC), sends diagnostics to the Raspberry Pi. Findings: Compared with other microcontrollers such as Arduino, the Raspberry Pi was chosen because it sustains the application to receive real-time diagnostics, process the diagnostics and send commands to automobiles at the same time, rather than Arduino that must wait for another process finished to run another process. Originality/value: This paper also represents the history of mobile technology and OBD-II technology, comparison between Arduino and Raspberry Pi and Node. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

An increase in the usage of automation leads to the advancement of today’s world. Self-driving cars are autonomous vehicles that can drive themselves without the need for human intervention, and they have the ability to usher in the next decade’s technological revolution. In this project, we have used image processing and machine learning based on Raspberry Pi 3 B+. The visual component that allows the robot to observe its environment is the Pi camera. The Pi camera delivers graphical data to the Raspberry Pi, which is subsequently forwarded to the motor module. This autonomous car is capable of arriving at the required destination by avoiding human errors, following road safety, and also adapts to the environment. The self-driving car which was developed operates well and is unique due to the integration of lane/lane change detection, obstacle detection, traffic light, and sign-detection capabilities. The proposed vehicle represents the future of vehicle industry, allowing drivers to be less concerned about accidents. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Driver's drowsiness is one of the leading contributing factors to the increasing accidents statistics in Malaysia. Therefore, the design and development of driver drowsiness detection based on image processing using Raspberry Pi camera module sensor interfacing with Raspberry Pi 3 board are proposed in this paper. To achieve the aim of the research, the Haar Cascade Classifier algorithm is implemented for eyes and face detection whereas for eyes blink (open and close) detection, the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) algorithm is employed. From several experiments conducted on six recruited subjects, the findings revealed that the accuracy of Haar Cascade classifier to detect the eyes and faces was subjected to correct sitting position (head must facing to the camera) as well as the eyes must not be covered with glasses or shades. Meanwhile, the range of average EAR value detected by the system was between 0.141 (eyes closed) and 0.339 (eyes opened). In conclusion, the image processing-based Haar Cascade and EAR algorithms utilized on Raspberry Pi platform have been successfully executed. For future improvement, the current board can be replaced with Raspberry Pi Touch Screen to minimize the hardware setup and the physiological based analysis using alcohol and heart rate sensors can be added. © 2019 by authors.},

Through the implementation of Daugman algorithm on Raspberry Pi, more applications may come up for iris recognition. Also to make the system adapt with the limitations of Raspberry Pi and the existing application, this work created an image processing function that preprocesses the image before it is passed to the application. Based on the tests implemented, the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR), the system is mostly to reject registered actors than to accept impostors due to the hardware limitations. © 2016 IEEE.},

On the other hand, connecting more and more smart devices poses the challenges of how to protect them effectively from remote malicious interference. An important aspect of student's learning is the acquisition of practical knowledge and skills related to the use of "smart"devices. Many of these devices are based on the use of typical operating systems, thus the experience that is gained based on studying a particular structure is transformed relatively easily and quickly to any system. The purpose of this work is to identify and investigate vulnerabilities and develop relevant effective protection for Raspberry Pi devices. The study was conducted using real and virtual Raspberry Pi's, thus enabling to simulate and model a particular type of attack and penetration method.  © 2022 IEEE.},

This paper describes a thoroughly research on four different face detectors using the two most popular computer vision libraries (i.e., OpenCV and Dlib), and compares the detecting speed of those detectors. The face detectors, which are examined in all experiments, include two classic detectors (Haar and HOG based face detector) and two newer, deep neural networks based detectors. Also, four different Raspberry Pi models including Raspberry Pi Zero W, Pi 2, Pi 3, and Pi 4 are put into the experiments of face detecting speed. The results show that the Raspberry Pi 2, Pi 3, and Pi 4 are capable of doing real-time face detection tasks using Haar or HOG based face detector, and all four Raspberry Pi models can be used in practical applications where face detection is required. For other detectors based on deep neural networks, although are not suitable for face related real-time tasks, they are still effectively used in many other face related computer vision tasks.  © 2021 Author(s).},

To automate a machine, a secondary brain (another machine) is required to 'Think' and control machines to do tasks as per the convenience of the user from long distances. An automation system is proposed for the users to control home electronic appliances with high mobility and security. A set of switches will be controlled by internet with the use of a Raspberry pi micro-controller board. A Raspberry pi micro-controller board obtains user input from a website that is accessed through a user name and password. The customized user friendly website has several buttons to control the appliances. A Raspberry pi will be located in a room and will be connected to all electronic appliances in the home with the help of electromagnetic relays. The Raspberry pi can be controlled from any distant place with the help of weaved cloud service. Webiopi framework gives us a platform to interact with Raspberry pi's General Purpose Input Output pins. The Raspberry pi then either passes or stops current through an electromagnetic relay connected to the intended switch and this closes/opens the circuit allowing the appliance to run or get switched off. Thus globally accessible automation of electronic appliances can be made possible with the use of a Raspberry Pi micro-controller board, an internet connection and relay switches in a user friendly way. © 2015 IEEE.},

Computers are also contributing some amount in the pollution and power consumption. On the other hand, miniaturization, less power consumption, and environment-friendly devices are invented by the researchers every day. One such device is Raspberry Pi. Size of the Raspberry Pi is not bigger than a credit card with high computing capacity and low power consumption. Pi can run Linux as well as Windows 10 in its higher versions. This paper aims to suggest the Pi can be used for practicing most of the laboratory courses in the computer science engineering curriculum. Most laboratory courses are practiced in C, C++, and Java languages. Apart from above-mentioned languages, some laboratory courses make use of front end and back end tools. Above-mentioned languages can be executed in Raspberry Pi. Following points are analyzed between normal computer and Pi, execution time, power consumption, and environmental effect. In all the comparison, Pi gives much higher advantage over existing system. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

The first is a Raspberry Pi, to be installed in each class, and the second is a web application fed by data from the Raspberry Pi. To take attendance, an instructor commands a Raspberry Pi camera through a web-based subsystem. Then, the camera takes a picture of the whole class and detects faces using trained Haar Cascades. It sends back a file with the class picture and Cartesian coordinates of the detected faces. The web application parses the file, looking for the coordinates of faces. For each Region of Interest, it uses the Support Vector Machine algorithm to recognize faces based on their HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features. The recognizer uses a pre-built dataset of that particular class containing the students' personal photos, names and ID numbers. Features of each face were extracted using HOG and trained to construct the model over a given class of students. Once every detected face is recognized, the application generates a report for the instructor showing the list of students' names and attendance status. © 2022},

It was created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation charity, whose primary goal was the re-introduction of computer skills learning among students. The Raspbian operating system is based on Linux and offers an excellent working environment for students, as it includes software solutions designed to expand students' knowledge of computer science in an interesting way. Besides computer science knowledge, it is also suitable for acquiring basic knowledge in electronics. It is also very important to have the possibility of interconnecting such acquired knowledge. Our students have adopted the knowledge how to install and use the Raspbian operating system, how to network and connect to the Internet, how to write programs using the Python programming language, and how to develop hardware-based projects. From our own experience in Raspberry Pi we can conclude that this is an ideal platform for students to acquire new knowledge and competences in the field of computer science and electronics. © 42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2019 - Proceedings.

A robot-car is developed which is controlled by the gesture commands provided to the Raspberry Pi controller. The model has two components a car and a control station. The control station is computer that has gesture recognition hardware so that it can detect the commands and send them to the car. The control station is the microcomputer Raspberry Pi model 3B. The data from the hand movements acquired from the accelerometer sensor are fed to the motor driver L293D through the Raspberry Pi, which converts electrical energy to mechanical energy to drive the robot-car. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Internet-of-Things or IoT technology becomes essential in everyday lives. The risk of security and privacy towards IoT devices, especially smarthomes IoT gateway device, becoming apparent as IoT technology progressed. The need for affordable, secure smarthome gateway device or router that smarthome user prefer. The problem of low-performance smarthome gateways was running security programs on top of smarthome gateway programs. This problem motivates the researcher designing a secure and efficient smarthome gateway using Raspberry Pi hardware as an affordable smarthome gateway device and able to run both smarthome gateways and security programs. In this research, researchers implemented snort as intrusion detection system (IDS), openHab as IoT gateway applications, and well-known encryption algorithms for file encryption in Raspberry PI 3B+ model. The researcher evaluated Snort capability on network attacks and compared each of the well-known encryption algorithm efficiency. From the result, we found Rasefiberry customized snort configuration for Raspberry pi 60 percent of the simulated network attacks. Twofish encryption algorithms were found to have best encryption time, throughput, and power consumption compared to other encryption algorithms in the research. Rasefiberry architecture successfully processes both lightweight security programs and Openhab smarthome gateway programs with a low-performance computing device such as Raspberry Pi. © 2021, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The image processing tasks and interfacing to the camera could be accomplished by the Raspberry Pi mounted on the gun.

In this study, a system is designed to continuously monitor the Electrocardiogram (ECG) and other vital parameters. This data is stored in a database and can be displayed in a website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel. This idea is familiar however; this paper presents a substantive and inexpensive method using Raspberry pi. The primary task of this system is to update the data to the database and alert the doctors for any aberrancy. The former is accomplished by using MySQLdb module to link Raspberry pi to the database whereas the latter is achieved by the combination of Raspberry Pi and GSM module. This system has much future scope as the data gathered by monitoring is so valuable and can be used for scientific research by the medical community. By determining the patterns in the parameters observed, the nature of disease can be predicted. The paper mainly emphasizes on the system design and the algorithm used to accomplish the task. The obtained results are presented. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Raspberry Pi has evolved in recent years into a popular, low-cost, tiny computer for a wide range of IoT applications. Raspberry Pi is not only successful for data collection but also for data processing, including data storage and analysis. Thus, this study investigates the capability of Raspberry Pi as an edge processing device for capturing lightning strike signals in predicting flash flood locations. An electric and magnetic sensor (EMS) is connected to a Raspberry Pi in the experiment setup. The Raspberry Pi is then used to process digitised lightning signals. From the experiment, Raspberry Pi’s performance is measured using the performance metrics: central processing unit (CPU) usage and temperature. The results revealed that the Raspberry Pi could handle the real-time collection and processing of lightning signals from the EMSs without affecting the hardware capability. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

To find out a displaced object, the algorithm tries to guess the direction of displaced object rather than scanning the second image for the matching pixel. This can be done by solving for the optical flow vector by assuming that the vector will be similar to a small neighbourhood surrounding the pixel. The algorithm was simulated using Python OpenCV. The implementation of Lucas-Kanade algorithm was successfully done on Raspberry Pi. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Ongoing ransomware attacks have forced business to think about security of their resources. Recently, small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) have become easy targets for attackers since they don’t have cyber defense mechanism in place other than simple firewall systems which are quite vulnerable. Cyber defense systems are costly and often not within the budget of SMEs which inspired to think about low cost yet highly efficient cyber defense solutions. This research explores the prospects of implementing a Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi)-based intelligent cyber-defense system (iCDS) for SME networks and Smart-homes to filter malicious contents from incoming traffic. Primarily, the work presented in this paper tries to evaluate the hardware capability of network interfaces (both internal, and attached) of Raspberry Pi for handle high volumes of incoming traffic. For this, we measure the network performance of the Raspberry Pi using the speed test software. The results show that the built in Ethernet interface outperforms the built in WiFi and external attached USB to Ethernet Adapter in terms of latency, download and upload throughput. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Raspberry Pi is a system built-in and is a low-cost computer that can be used to reduce system complexity in real-time applications. For programming, it's very good to use Python. Raspberry pi has a Camera Slot Interface (CSI) to interface the camera with Raspberry Pi. Low contrast images captured using the Raspberry Pi camera module can be scaled up first to identify specific image regions. The most important processing is the removal of noise as a result of noise disturbance during image acquisition on the camera. Due to its small size, which is about the size of a credit card and its lightweight, raspberry pi is very suitable for use as a portable medical image processing system. Besides that Raspberry Pi also consumes low power.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Hence, this research of developing a compact computational constrained travel aid to help them easily tackle the daily practice is a necessity. As there are approximately 1.3 billion visually impaired people, having a low-cost solution for them is an important requirement. To match this condition, we have used raspberry pi 3 and pi 4 tagged with the pi camera and sonar sensor, all of which are budget-friendly and serves our purpose. This system is attached to a cane and notifies the user about the nature and range of object with the help of sonar sensor and images captured from the pi camera. We have used the lighter versions of You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) model that has been deployed on both raspberry pi 3 and pi 4. The performance of both versions of raspberry with different models has been tested in an outdoor scenario. It has been observed that raspberry pi 4 is twice faster than pi 3 and the overall performance of Tiny YOLOv3 (Model2) is best in comparison to other models on both pi 3 and pi 4. © 2019 IEEE.},

Raspberry Pi is a very powerful processor where machine learning can be integrated very easily like SVM, KNN, and Tensor Flow, etc. Blind People can easily identify their native family members by using their voice. When family members stop talking, it's quite impossible to identify the man near the blind man. So, here we introduce a Raspberry pi based system that can easily identify the person in front of the blind man and give audio name information. In this system, we use raspberry pi face recognition, face encoding, and face database creation for family member face recognition. So this device can be a great assistive device for the blind man.

	abstract = {Traditional methods of measuring a vessel's motion involve the use of bulky sensor units which usually require cables. These devices are not only expensive, but are difficult and time-consuming to install. They are simply not affordable and do not provide owners of vessels with a cost effective way of measuring and monitoring their vessels' motion during operation. Measured vessel motion could be used to deduce the sea state using the wave buoy analogy. This additional information could be crucial in improving operational safety for vessels. If motion monitoring is to be used to help improve a vessel's operational stability and provide operational critical information, cheaper and simpler alternatives are needed. In this paper, we present a novel motion measurement system which uses a Raspberry Pi with a wireless module and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor to measure a vessel's motions. The data collected can either be stored locally on the Raspberry Pi or be sent wirelessly to the user. Compared to traditional devices, the Raspberry Pi is cheaper and easier to install. In addition, due to its computing power, some of the post-processing of data, which is traditionally done on a computer separate from the measuring unit, can be done on the Raspberry Pi. For a practical evaluation of using the Raspberry Pi to measure ship motion, it was placed on a fishing vessel for two hours. The IMU used measured nine degrees of freedom, all of which were recorded at 50 Hz on the Raspberry Pi. Afterwards, the data was taken from the Raspberry Pi wirelessly and analysed using Matlab, firstly to ensure that the right data was collected at the right frequency, and secondly to visualise the data. The evaluation shows that using the Raspberry Pi, as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, is a light-weight, cost-effective, and easy-to-install alternative to traditional devices for measuring vessel motion. © 2015 IEEE.},

Building on this work, we report our experiences from developing a series of low-cost Raspberry Pi clusters for use with open distance university students. Based on survey results from 484 students, we argue that our work demonstrates the benefits that remote practical activities can have for teaching PDC concepts, as well as engaging students.

It recommends priority to existing main camera with results given by analysis. It is expected to contribute to efficient monitoring in integrated centers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {The performance of the Raspberry Pi 4B computer was evaluated for three cases. First, a Raspberry Pi heterogeneous MPICH cluster with weight-based load balancing and fuzzy estimation of node computational performance was designed. Fuzzification, formation of fuzzy rules, fuzzy inference, and defuzzification were employed to determine the performance weights. In the cluster with two Raspberry Pi 4B boards with 2 GB RAM and Raspberry Pi 64-bit OS and one Raspberry Pi 3B board with 1 GB RAM and Raspberry Pi 32-bit OS, the recommended performance weights are (5, 5, 1), respectively. The developed Python program for the prime numbers finding algorithm employs the proposed weight-based load balancing, which is approximately five times faster than the basic algorithm with equal loading for the maximum integer of 300000. Second, the MPICH cluster with two nodes in two virtual machines located on two different Raspberry Pi 4B boards with Ubuntu Server for ARM on the hypervisor VMware ESXi ARM Fling shows the mean signed deviation −34.01 s regarding the Raspberry Pi 64-bit OS for the maximum integer of 300000. Third, the performance of the Raspberry Pi 4B 8 GB computer with Windows 11 ARM OS was compared with the laptop Lenovo G510 with Intel Core i7-4700MQ and Windows 10 64-bit OS using the combinatorial optimization algorithm implemented in the 32-bit Windows app. The Raspberry Pi 4B 8 GB consumed approximately six times more power. Thus, the Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer is recommended for executing low-performance applications and/or short-term processing of high-performance tasks. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Working age members have to work outside in the day time to get enough income for the family. Elderly are forced to live alone and facing a difficulty because they cannot see things clearly. In this research, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for household objects finder and localizer is proposed. Raspberry Pi 3 is used to create a wearable device for elderly to help see objects and tell the type and location of the objects via voice. YOLO neuron network is selected because of the speed and resource consumption. Data set of household objects images was prepared and fed into YOLO network as training inputs. Training process is done on a desktop computer before transferred into Raspberry Pi 3. Trained YOLO can classify and local several objects in the same time with accuracy of 83%. By using PeachPy and NEON instruction set for compiling YOLO in ARM environment, the speed of detection and localization in Raspberry Pi 3 equals to 0.8 seconds per image. Prototype of wearable device is built by using a camera, headphone, push switch, battery and Raspberry Pi 3. Device will capture an image when a push switch is pressed and Raspberry Pi returns pre-recorded voice results consist of objects types and their locations through headphone to elderly. © 2018 IEEE.},

This study trials the use of a Pi Spark cluster for distributed inference in TensorFlow. Specifically, it investigates the performance difference between a 2-node Pi 4B Spark cluster and other systems, including a single Pi 4B and a mid-end desktop computer. Enhancements for the Pi 4B were studied and compared against the Spark cluster to identify the more effective method in increasing the Pi 4B’s DL performance. Three experiments involving DL inference, which in turn involve image classification and face detection tasks, were carried out. Results showed that enhancing the Pi 4B was faster than using a cluster as there was no significant performance difference between using the cluster and a single Pi 4B. The difference between the mid-end computer and a single Pi 4B was between 6 and 15 times in the experiments. In the meantime, enhancing the Pi 4B is the more effective approach for increasing the DL performance, and more work needs to be done for scalable distributed DL inference to eventuate. © 2022 by the authors.},

Two systems are based on Raspberry Pi, a low-cost embedded computer. First, Raspberry Pi controls camera to capture translucent image of duck eggs, then image processing algorithm is used to remove image noise and enhance image features. The trained convolutional neural network model is used to identify duck egg images. Identification results can be preserved, displayed, and prompted by Raspberry Pi.

Arduino microcontrollers are used to receive the on/off commands from the rasperry pi using zigbee protocol. Star zigbee topology serves as backbone for the communication between raspberry pi and end devices. Raspberry pi acts a central coordinator and end devices act as various routers. Low-cost and energy efficient drip irrigation system serves as a proof of concept. The design can be used in big agriculture fields as well as in small gardens via just sending an email to the system to water plants. The use of ultrasound sensors and solenoid valves make a smart drip irrigation system. The paper explains the complete installation of the system including hardware and software aspects.

More and more both hardware and software modules are available for that device. One of the later ones is CODESYS development environment, which make it possible to program Raspberry Pi like a regular Programmable Logic Controllers PLC. Using its network interfaces and industrial protocols like Ethercat or Profinet available in CODESYS, too, one could consider using Raspberry as a node in Networked Control System. Posts and opinions shared on Internet forums proofs it. However, one thing should not be ignored – Raspberry has been never intended to be implemented in industrial environment and was not designed as a real-time device. Therefore before practical application of Raspberry Pi, its temporal characteristics should be analyzed.

	abstract = {In this paper, we have proposed a technique using Raspberry Pi board as a small PC with Docker to implement the concept of virtualization. Docker which is used for running distributed applications in an open platform. This implementation shows how efficient it will be to implement server virtualization technique on simple computers like raspberry pi. The outcome will be a virtualized Raspberry Pi which will run various applications on the hypervisor. This method involves booting Arch Linux into the Raspberry Pi, and then installing a hypervisor into it. Virtual machines will be installed and keep running in the background. If the power consumed with virtualization is less than the power consumed when these processes are running in different hardware without any virtualization then it is concluded that virtualization is saving power and also reducing the hardware involved. Power monitoring software is used to measure the power consumed by the raspberry pi. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	abstract = {Image authentication approaches have gotten a lot of interest recently as a way to safeguard transmitted images. Watermarking is one of the many ways used to protect transmitted images. Watermarking systems are pc-based that have limited portability that is difficult to use in harsh environments as military use. We employ embedded devices like Raspberry Pi to get around the PC’s mobility limitations. Digital image watermarking technology is used to secure and ensure digital images’ copyright by embedding hidden information that proves its copyright. In this article, the color images Parallel Robust watermarking algorithm using Quaternion Legendre-Fourier Moment (QLFM) in polar coordinates is implemented on Raspberry Pi (RPi) platform with parallel computing and C++ programming language. In the host image, a binary Arnold scrambled image is embedded. Watermarking algorithm is implemented and tested on Raspberry Pi model 4B. We can combine many Raspberry Pi’s into a ‘cluster’ (many computers working together as one) for high-performance computation.

The training in Raspberry Pi is based on the idea of transfer learning. The features extraction part of the network loads the weight file, and only the fully connected classification layers are trained. Finally, the accuracy of train set and test set reach 99.8% and 94.4% respectively after training 100 epochs in Raspberry Pi. When epoch=10, the accuracy rate reaches the predetermined value.

	abstract = {—The objective of this paper is to conduct a bibliometric study on the use of Raspberry Pi in the medical field. In the past several decades healthcare advancements have played a major role and Raspberry Pi being the charm with its extensive features and low cost, it is of interest to know whether the development in health care technologies with respect to Raspberry Pi has created an impact or not. A platform known as Biblioshiny has been used to collect statistical information and perform the analysis. A total of 154 journal articles have been collected from PubMed, a free full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM) and analysis has been made on various parameters such as top authors, countries and affiliations etc. The conclusions drawn help us to understand the usage of Raspberry Pi in the healthcare domain. The Bibliometric Analysis done indicates that there has been an increase in the research over the years and the authors from various countries have been working elaborately indicating that there has been a good amount of usage of Raspberry Pi in the healthcare domain. Overall, our results demonstrate the trending topics the authors currently working on and collaborations amongst authors and countries. Finally, this paper identifies that there are no motor themes but displays the budding keywords (or the ideas where authors have worked on) in the health care domain emerging with the prototyping of Raspberry Pi. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.

	abstract = {Raspberry Pi, as a powerful single board computer, has become a very popular choice for prototyping IoT applications in lab environment, industrial projects, and education. Although Raspberry Pi supports many programming languages, Java, a main programing language, has not been used broadly. Current literature does not have sufficient details on how to build applications for Internet of Things (IoT) using Java, JavaFX, and Raspberry Pi as well. This paper introduces the results of studies carried out by the authors for finding out such details. The studies include an application with a JavaFX-based graphical user interface that controls an LED, a Java application that works with a temperature and humility sensor, and a Java application that interacts with Amazon's AWS IoT service. These applications all run on a Raspberry Pi. The main contribution of the paper is that it provides a systematic introduction to the details of the technologies of using Java, JavaFX and Raspberry Pi for developing IoT applications, including an example for the AWS IoT cloud service which has not been reported previously in the literature. The results of the paper are beneficial to developers with Java programming background who plan to develop IoT applications.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments are typically performed in controlled laboratory settings to minimise noise and produce reliable measurements. These controlled conditions also reduce the applicability of the obtained results to more varied environments and may limit their relevance to everyday situations. New method Advances in computer portability may increase the mobility and applicability of EEG results while decreasing costs. In this experiment we show that stimulus presentation using a Raspberry Pi 2 computer provides a low cost, reliable alternative to a traditional desktop PC in the administration of EEG experimental tasks. Results Significant and reliable MMN and P3 activity, typical event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with an auditory oddball paradigm, were measured while experiments were administered using the Raspberry Pi 2. While latency differences in ERP triggering were observed between systems, these differences reduced power only marginally, likely due to the reduced processing power of the Raspberry Pi 2. Comparison with existing method An auditory oddball task administered using the Raspberry Pi 2 produced similar ERPs to those derived from a desktop PC in a laboratory setting. Despite temporal differences and slight increases in trials needed for similar statistical power, the Raspberry Pi 2 can be used to design and present auditory experiments comparable to a PC. Results Our results show that the Raspberry Pi 2 is a low cost alternative to the desktop PC when administering EEG experiments and, due to its small size and low power consumption, will enable mobile EEG experiments unconstrained by a traditional laboratory setting. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The release of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or Bluetooth Smart, allows for a major improvement in data transfer using IPv6 over BLE, as proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 7668. IPv6 through BLE is widely used for IoT devices, however, connection to a raspberry pi 3 device, the most used mobile operating system, is widely underdeveloped. In this paper, we attempt to create a link-layer connection, guided by 6LoWPANs (stands for IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) from RFC 4919, between two raspberry pi 3s to transfer IPv6 packets. BlueZ, the default Linux Bluetooth protocol stack, is used as the foundation of this data transfer in both PIs. © 2018 IEEE.},

To demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested system, the demonstration has been implemented and shown in Raspberry Pi. The proposed approach includes an item or object that is identified using improved techniques for detecting edges. For calculating dimension, a reference item (a binary coded marker) has been taken based on characteristics that items used as reference can be identified easily and have fixed measurements. This model has been proposed using the Open CV python module in Raspberry Pi, for determining the dimensioning of an object using a fixed reference.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of electronic data has brought two major challenges, namely, how to store big data and how to process it. Two main problems in processing big data are the high cost and the computational power. Hadoop, one of the open source frameworks for processing big data, uses distributed computational model designed to be able to run on commodity hardware. The aim of this research is to analyze Hadoop cluster on Raspberry Pi as a commodity hardware for DNA sequence alignment. Six B Model Raspberry Pi and a Biodoop library were used in this research for DNA sequence alignment. The length of the DNA used in this research is between 5,639 bp and 13,271 bp. The results showed that the Hadoop cluster was running on the Raspberry Pi with the average usage of processor 73.08%, 334.69 MB of memory and 19.89 minutes of job time completion. The distribution of Hadoop data file blocks was found to reduce processor usage as much as 24.14% and memory usage as much as 8.49%. However, this increased job processing time as much as 31.53%. © 2016 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.},

Solar energy is now the ultimate option. In this paper, the instruments used to measure the solar radiation at Innovation Centre, MIT Manipal were connected to a Raspberry Pi to access the data remotely. Genetic Algorithms were formulated, so that the monthly mean global solar radiation in Manipal can be effectively estimated. Meteorological data such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, etc. were used as inputs to train the networks. A successful network was made between the data loggers and the Raspberry Pi. The data collected by the data loggers from the devices are transmitted to the Raspberry Pi which in turn sends the data to an internal server. The Raspberry Pi can be accessed using any SSH client such as PuTTY. The meteorological data was collected for the years 2010-2014 in order to formulate the Artificial Intelligence models. The validity of the formulated models were checked by comparing the measured data with the estimated data using tools such as RMSE, correlation coefficient, etc. The modelling of solar radiation using GA was carried out in GeneXpro tools version 5.0. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

In such situation, the management, monitoring and maintenance of such computer network requires special attention to ensure optimal network access capability is achieved. Wireless network traffic analysis is a process of recording, studying and analyzing packets in wireless network for network performance analysis purposes. In some cases, the quality of network access performance can be very low without knowing the actual problem. Therefore, in this paper, the performance of wireless network traffic is proposed to be analyzed by using a Raspberry Pi which further able to send an alert to network admin to lessen the downtime. Raspberry Pi is a low cost, a small and portable size of a computer board that can be used to plugin to monitor, keyboard, mouse, pen drive, etc. In this project, a MyTraceroute (MTR) program is installed on the Raspberry Pi to capture the IP of the Access Point (AP) and show packets loss percentage in the network. The results will be saved in the form of text file and sent to network admin by using email. The solution proposed in this paper is able to support solution to a problem on efficient monitoring, managing and maintaining wireless network traffics. © 2018 Authors.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing popularity of network operating system courses in vocational high schools, issues have been raised regarding the lack of appropriate computer hardware specifications and the limited use of real networking devices. The media that have been used in teaching network operating systems have been based on virtualization-based simulation. However, such virtualization does not expose students to real hardware. This results in less than optimal hands-on activities and students' psychomotor abilities. Consequently, alternative authentic media are needed to accommodate practical learning and improve psychomotor skills. The aim of this study is to explore the implementation of a single-board microcomputer in learning network operating systems. The Raspberry Pi was chosen as it can replace the role of a non-simulation PC. The choice of Raspberry Pi was also based on the fact that in Indonesia it is still rare to find its implementation for teaching and learning activities in vocational high school, so it is necessary to introduce the device to students. The operating system used by the Raspberry Pi is similar to Ubuntu, which is one of the network operating systems that must be mastered by vocational IT students. The research made a comparison between the two learning media as employed by two groups of students in different classes, one using virtualization-based simulation and the other using the Raspberry Pi. Based on the results, it is concluded that the use of the Raspberry Pi is more effective than that of virtualization-based simulation in improving students' psychomotor and troubleshooting skills.  © 2021 Puspanda Hatta and Cucuk Wawan Budiyanto, published by De Gruyter 2021.},

	abstract = {Wildlife monitoring in zoological parks using raspberry pi is the application of science and technology to monitor the wildlife enclosures in zoological parks and to maintain the security of animals. Recently many incidents that occur in zoo parks like animals escaping form cages and causing damage to other animals and humans, and also sometimes humans also fall into the enclosures of animals. Hence, designed a system that can monitor such conditions. This system is used for surveillance and security of animal to detect the intruder that entered the area of animals and also to detect if the animal escaped or missing from the enclosure. This system could also label what intruder has entered the enclosure using Machine Learning. The system consists of raspberry pi camera Rev 1.3 and SD card circuitry interfaced to a raspberry pi B+ board The raspberry pi camera takes the video of the cage and gives to the raspberry pi, then the obtained video streaming data is analyzed using opencv platform. In opencv platform the data is classified using Machine Learning algorithms. The data is analyzed to check whether any intruder entered the cage or if the animal escaped from the cage. If any of the conditions mentioned above occurs then the alerts are sent to the caretaker using IoT. © BEIESP.},

Information technology also has offered significant advantages and facilities to improve the quality of voting process. Digital recording electronic systems are developed replacing paper ballots. Although this is a great advancement, this process is prone to tampering threats and electoral frauds. This paper presents a new voting process which makes use of Raspberry Pi which has improved reliability and transparency over currently used systems. This system employs biometric identifiers in pursuit of authenticity. Pre collected details of all the voters in the country will be maintained as a central database by the government. This data is rechecked at the time of voting to ensure the identity of voters. Usage of Raspberry Pi for web casting the complete voting process and time to time display of polling percentage etc., details will tremendously affect the reliability of the process. Transparency and minimum usage of personnel is achieved at a cheaper cost and simpler process with this Raspberry Pi and its peripherals. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In developing countries the newborn swapping and abduction in hospitals are challenging issue and occurs all over the world. Traditional methods have their own drawbacks. Hence, a newborn personal authentication system is proposed for this issue based on bimodal biometric system wherein footprint of newborn and finger print of their mother is used for recognition. This concept is further enhanced by developing a prototype to be implemented on a raspberry Pi (a single board computer). In this paper, SIFT feature extraction, RANSAC algorithm for matching of fingerprint and footprint biometrics using OpenCV on Raspberry pi is implemented. The raspberry Pi is ARM1176JZFS application processor, System on chip (SoC) denoted as Broadcom BCM2835. It enhances performance, consumes less power, and reduces overall system cost and size. The raspberry Pi is been controlled by a modified version of Debian Linux optimized for ARM architecture. The image recognition is performed using open source OpenCV-2.4.9 in Linux platform using CMake, g++, makefile. Thereby the proposed system improves the security system in hospitals/birth centers and provides a low cost solution to the newborn swapping rather than the expensive DNA procedures. In this paper, discusses about the research works carried on hardware as a biometric module to enhance the performance of a standalone device. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The physical breach across the borders is a very common issue these days among nations sharing boundaries. It is controlled via proper border surveillance system. The border surveillance system is trivially a physical border intrusion detection system in which CCTV cameras are used traditionally to observe manually the presence of some intruder. Instead, we utilize the raspberry PI controller board based wireless sensor nodes fitted with raspberry PI camera for identifying the intruder. Once the intruder is identified, the wireless sensor nodes communicate the messages with the next hop sensor nodes and the message ultimately reaches the control room from where army action may be initiated. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight security scheme (LSS) for raspberry PI based wireless node communication for the Border Surveillance System. We have utilized the XBee (Zigbee) serial communication between raspberry PI based wireless sensor nodes. The proposed scheme is based upon the notion of confusion and correct identification of pattern (byte) in the transmitted messages. The entire communication scheme is lightweight and secure. © 2021.

This study presented a remote monitoring system for a direct current (DC) motor based on Internet of Things (IoT) for safe and economic data communication in industrial fields. A single sensor monitors the DC motor speed and sends it to the Raspberry Pi microcontroller, which sends it to the cloud database for remote monitoring. The system also presents the manual control methods to adjust the motor speed using a simple potentiometer. Therefore, the proposed system has three functions: measuring, monitoring, and controlling. Measuring is based on an optoisolator sensor and an Arduino Mega microcontroller. Controlling is based on the Potentiometer, Arduino Uno, and a motor drive circuit. Monitoring is based on Raspberry Pi and ThingSpeak platform. Firstly, the speed sensor HC-020K senses the speed Data. Secondly, Arduino Mega extracts the HC-020K sensor's data as a suitable revolution per minute and sends it to Raspberry Pi. Thirdly, Raspberry Pi sends the data to ThingSpeak's Server. Lastly, based on the experiments performed, the system has proved to be very useful and reliable.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {At the moment, the best and only way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 is by limiting close contact with others. Respecting social distance, infection is less probable. Since this is a new lifestyle for everyone, it’s hard to be distance all the times. People forget to keep distance or they are not taking seriously the actual situation. That’s why in this paper, we propose a smart surveillance solution. Our test prototype ensures the respect of social distancing by detecting persons, calculating distances between them and generating loud vocal alerts. The smart surveillance prototype is based on Raspberry Pi and Camera Pi. Then, we make a comparison study of object detection pretrained models. SSD-MobileNet gives the most satisfying result using Raspberry pi with limited computing resources. Despite that implementing CNN based model on the Raspberry Pi is such a challenging work, we reach a value of 1,1 FPS on real-time object detection and distance analysis system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

So, to overcome this problem we have designed a framework based on SSH with multi-threading though there are various tools, our analytical experimental studies show that SSH with multi-threading or multiprocessing is far better than these tools. This Framework which designed by us will parallelly login into nearly 100s of server or clusters of servers (created using cluster algorithm designed by us.) at once and can run some automated activity like updating software, running some test cases like stressing processors memory or performing some activity which can be controlled by Raspberry pi or get logs, etc. This Framework is very useful for hardware controlled by server or Raspberry pi server industries, especially in the condition like COVID-19. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Breast thermography is a promising medical imaging technique for the detection of breast cancer. However, providing a robust and portable computer-aided diagnostic system for breast thermography remains a tedious task. In this paper, a computer-aided diagnostic system based on breast thermography is developed and implemented on a Raspberry Pi 4 using the cloud computing services to provide the computing power needed for machine learning algorithms. Image processing techniques such as preprocessing and segmentation are employed to achieve an adequate feature extraction task. The support vector machine classifier is used in the final stage to classify the breast as normal or abnormal. According to the experimental results, the proposed computer-aided diagnostic system has shown high performance in both the segmentation and classification steps. Furthermore, a low computation time was obtained when using the high computing capabilities of the cloud with the Raspberry Pi. We conclude that the implementation of such a decision support system on the Raspberry Pi especially when using the cloud computing services, can be a reliable tool for radiologists to predict breast abnormalities even in the rural backcountry where there is lack of health services. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Being a computer it runs on a full operating system and can be interfaced with a wide range of hardware. Its ability to collect and store data and its superior processing capabilities gives it an edge over other microprocessors. When used to collect data away from the grid, alternative methods of powering the Raspberry Pi have to be used. An ideal powering system should be autonomous, allowing the Raspberry Pi to be deployed indefinitely without the need to check on the system due to power shortcomings. In this paper we introduce the DSAIL Power Management Board that is used to power the Raspberry Pi autonomously.

We designed doctors and nurses to check the status of patients through the Android app in real time. We also added a macro function in our system to easily register frequently-sent messages from patients. In this system, patients can register daily status by individual date and doctors can access the web server and monitor the patient's condition in real time through the web and the app. Therefore, it is designed to enable stable system operation. © Medwell Journals, 2017.},

Many commercial options for wildlife observation are expensive, obtrusive, or sub-optimal in remote environments. In this paper, we explore the viability of a Raspberry Pi-based camera system augmented with a deep learning image recognition model for detecting wildlife of interest. Unlike traditional sensor nodes that would have to transmit every captured image, localized image recognition enables only pictures of desired animals to be transferred to the user. For the purposes of this study, we use TensorFlow and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. We trained the model on nearly 3,600 images gathered from publicly available image databases that are split into three classes. Our experiments suggest that our system can detect snow leopards with between 74 percent and 97 percent accuracy. We believe that our results show the viability of employing deep learning image recognition models on the Raspberry Pi to create an inexpensive system to observe wildlife. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Conventional weed control system is usually used by spraying herbicides uniformly throughout the land. Excessive use of herbicides on an ongoing basis can produce chemical waste that is harmful to plants and soil. The application of precision agriculture farming in the detection process in order to control weeds using Computer Vision On Farm becomes interesting, but it still has some problems due to computer size and power consumption. Raspberry Pi is one of the minicomputer with low price and low power consumption. Having computing like a desktop computer with the open source Linux operating system can be used for image processing and weed fractal dimension processing using OpenCV library and C programming. This research results the best fractal computation time when performing the image with dimension size of 128 x 128 pixels. It is about 7 milliseconds. Furthermore, the average speed ratio between personal computer and Raspberry Pi is 0.04 times faster. The use of Raspberry Pi is cost and power consumption efficient compared to personal computer. © 2016 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Raspberry Pi has become one of the most popular devices used in the internet of things studies because of its flexibility and affordability for prototyping purposes. It has found its niche in wireless sensor networks as it can function both as sensor node and router node just by adding wireless adapter. Studies have employed the Raspberry Pi as WSN mesh node and sensor node. These studies looked on the performance of these devices on single flow of data and/or on limited number of hops. Indirectly, they say these devices performs poorly on multihop and multi-flow experimental scenarios. Our experiments show that for multi-hop and multi-flow of scenarios, the raspberry pi nodes actually have enough resource and capacity to maintain good performance. Data flows simply share these resources amongst themselves that results to smaller throughput per flow. We show the appropriateness of Raspberry Pi not only as a sensor node but at the same time act as a mesh node for wireless sensor network studies in different scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been reported in the literature which should be helpful to other researchers. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to develop a smart building-security system utilizing fog technology. Fog computing is an innovative solution to reduce latency and network congestion, in which the cloud is extended to the edge of the network. The proposed system can detect an intruder, fire and water leakage. It is implemented using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Pi-camera and different sensors. The sensors are installed on Arduino and Pi-camera is mounted on Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is used as a fog node to fit the time-sensitive nature of the system. The performance was evaluated through the iFogSim toolkit. Fog reduces 33.26 and 46.8% average latency and sensor delay as compared to the cloud. Also, the value of the network usage decreases by 71% in the case of fog-based even with increased network load. Finally, the iFogSim was evaluated by measuring the simulation time, which gave acceptable results of about 8.5 sec. © 2020 Maha Medhat, Khaled El-Shafey and Ali Rashed.},

	abstract = {The process of rehabilitation of a stroke patient is long and complex, yet it is necessary to recover the flexibility of muscle movement and reduce the risk of a recurrent stroke. Thus, this paper uses flex force smart gloves to assist physicians to remotely monitor the rehabilitation process of stroke patients via data collection gloves using flex sensors. In this work, Raspberry Pi is used to connect to the Internet and, in conjunction with the Arduino platform, to interface with the electronic components of the system. Performance analysis on Arduino and Raspberry Pi has shown that Arduino is capable of output data at an average interval of 1,785 ms at a baud rate of 115,200 baud. However, communication between Arduino and Raspberry Pi reduces performance to an average of 5,421 ms. In addition, this paper also demonstrated the ability of Raspberry Pi to perform complex processes without significant performance degradation in this application. The final system has shown its ability to read, process, record and relay data from the data gloves. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The proposed system is for Smart Door lock technique with Raspberry Pi using IoT and is done by integrating webcam and motion sensor with e-mail. Raspberry Pi operates and controls motion sensor and webcam for sensing and surveillance. For instance, whenever any motion is detected, the webcam streaming starts and Raspberry Pi device alerts the owner through an e-mail on his registered mail-id. Whenever it is a wrong or random PIN entered, webcam captures the intruder's image and sends it over e-mail for real-time action to be taken by the owner to prevent theft. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Raspberry ketone is a primary aroma component of the red raspberry. The glycosylation of this compound is a potential approach used to improve its pharmaceutical properties. In this work, raspberry ketone glycosides are produced in bacteria for the first time. Bacillus licheniformis PI15, an organic solvent-tolerant glycosyltransferase-producing strain, was isolated from chemically polluted soil. The cloning and heterologous expression of a glycosyltransferase, which was designated PI-GT1, in Escherichia coli BL21 resulted in the expression of an active and soluble protein that accounted for 15% of the total cell protein content. Purified PI-GT1 was highly active and stable over a broad pH range (6.0–10.0) and showed excellent pH stability. PI-GT1 maintained almost 60% of its maximal activity after 3 H of incubation at 20–40 °C and demonstrated optimal activity at 30 °C. Additionally, PI-GT1 displayed high stability and activity in the presence of hydrophilic solvents with log P ≤ −0.2 and retained more than 80% of its activity after 3 H of treatment. Supplementation with 10% DMSO markedly improved the glycosylation of raspberry ketone, resulting in a value 26 times higher than that in aqueous solution. The organic solvent-tolerant PI-GT1 may have potential uses in industrial chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis applications. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Raspberry Pi is a small and low-cost computing device with features that suggest its application as embedded control hardware in mobile robots, aiming the implementation of computer vision and motion control, for example. However, the default operating system of the Raspberry Pi limits its performance in real time. In order to enable it to work in real time, the RT-Preempt patch was installed, which incorporates features of a real-time operating system into Linux. Installing the RT-Preempt patch generates changes to the Linux kernel that reduce its limitations and consequently improve the system's temporal performance. Several system performance tests were performed, measuring the latencies obtained in different situations, such as: polling, timed loop, hardware interrupt and software interrupt. The experimental results confirm a significant improvement in the temporal performance of the system and show the limitations found regarding the use of the Raspberry Pi with the RT-Preempt patch in real-time applications. Based on these results, it can be concluded that it can be used as a low cost solution in non-critical real-time applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

Plus, the performance of the system is also analyzed using different type of antennas such as the Raspberry Pi 3 Antenna, monopole antenna, and a Yagi Uda antenna in terms of power received versus distance in both line of sight position and non-line of sight position. Finally, antenna that produces the best performance for line-of-sight (LOS) propagation is Yagi Uda antenna while monopole antenna is better when it comes to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.},

In this work, we first discuss the idea of the genome, its importance and wide-ranging applications in healthcare and medicine. We then give a brief overview of the various file formats used presently to store and manipulate genomic data along with their benefits and shortcomings. Moving on, we analyze and elaborate on how parallel and distributed computing can help in processing large files with genomic data and more importantly address the problem of pattern matching. In particular, we introduce the raspberry-pi and discuss in detail how a Raspberry Pi can accomplish the pattern matching task and how a Raspberry-Pi cluster can enable parallel computing to improvise the performance. This work also includes a brief account of various high-level application programming interfaces and libraries that can be used to parse genomic data like BioPython and Fuzzywuzzy. We conclude this work by summarizing some techniques that can be used for encoding and compressing files with genomic data like Run-Length encoding and genome differential compression respectively among other methods. The proposed work improvises the Genome pattern matching time by more than 50% in a distributed Raspberry Pi Computing environment. This system is useful to detect a particular genome-based abnormality where different pieces of Genome records are present on the different nodes in distributed computing and the input is given to find the disease. It can detect the abnormality within a short time. Also the different approach used here is to use Raspberry Pi based clustering to save cost and the energy. © 2020 The Authors.

One of the things that is important when keeping a cat is feeding. However, keeping a cat at home takes time and effort. In this digital era, the use of technology has penetrated all aspects of life. The objective of this research is to create a monitoring system for an automatic cat feeder using a webcam and a stepper motor that is connected to a Raspberry Pi as the main controller. The webcam can take pictures (photographs or videos) processed with the fswebcam and the avconv functions on the Raspberry Pi. The stepper motor can rotate the feed valve by utilising a General-Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pin and a program which is inserted into the Raspberry Pi. Next, the Raspberry Pi will be connected to the Internet and a server network so that the system control can be done remotely by using a web browser or web view on a mobile. The overall function of the system in the form of feeding the cat either directly or scheduled, as well as monitoring of photographs or videos around the feed. The results of a questionnaire showed that this system has a need value of 87.3% of 79 respondent cat keepers, meaning cat keepers will be greatly helped by the existence of this system. © 2020, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.},

When information is transmitted through an LED light, the flickering is faster than the human eye can perceive. The information is transmitted faster using Li-Fi when compared to Wi-Fi. In this paper, we propose a prototype where we use Raspberry Pi to retrieve images stored in it, convert it into bits, and send information using LED. This information is captured by a solar panel and is converted into an image using another Raspberry Pi. We also simulate the process of converting image into bits in the transmission side and converting received bits into an image at the receiver side using Python code. Li-Fi enables us to use a broader light spectrum when compared to the radio spectrum used by Wi-Fi which is crowded. Li-Fi has found its applications in hospitals, schools, and workplaces. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

In order to minimize the computing load on the Android device, some parts of the signal processing are moved to the data acquisition module by using Raspberry Pi 3 as the processor. In the Raspberry machine, a QRS detection system with Zero Cross Algorithm was implemented and its performance was measured. To measure the performance of the algorithm, a timer was placed before and after the execution of the process. The result shows that the algorithm can be run in real-time use in Raspberry Pi 3, although it is a bit slow and produced a high computational load of a single core processor in the machine. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

IOT smart objects and it's components interact with other components Ex: proxies, mobile devices and data collectors along with various sensors for management, data sharing and other activities in the context of provided services. In recent years Raspberry Pi is being used enormously for the implementation of IOT applications. Here in particular we use Raspberry Pi to capture and compress images. Raspberry Pi board is mounted with PIR sensor which detects the movements around it, and a Pi camera which captures the image when movement is encountered the captured image is compressed on the raspberry pi using SVD compression methodology after which the compressed image is transmitted over the network to the desktop application where it is decompressed on the receiving end using Matlab. The primary aim of this paper is to achieve image compression which reduces considerable image size in terms of bytes during transmission to reduce latency issues and communication bandwidth during transmission of the image over the network and simultaneously preserve the useful features of the image. © 2017 IEEE.},

According to the Perkins School for the Blind, only 2% to 8% of blind people use white canes. This is because 90% of them have accidents when using walking sticks. We have created a system to help the visually-impaired upgrading the white cane by implementing four essential elements: An electrical-setup employing a simple computer board (Raspberry Pi), connected to an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves, and voice feedback that alerts the owner of nearby objects via a speaker. Furthermore, a Raspberry Pi Camera for real-time object detection with a deep learning algorithm capability “YOLO” is used. The locations of these elements in the white cane are situated in the blind spots to avoid accidents to the owner. © 2022, Avestia Publishing. All rights reserved.},

Unlike microcontrollers, SBCs are fully functioning computers with more memory and processing power than the typical sensor. Their powerful System-on-a-Chip (SoC) processors make SBCs good candidates for at-node data summarization tasks in a wireless sensor network [1]. Reducing data transfer in a wireless sensor network is critical for energy efficiency and improved latency [2].

	abstract = {In recent times the Software Defined Networking paradigm has risen as a solution for static configuration and to enforce the fulfillment of network policies. For this reason we analyze the Zodiac FX and Raspberry PI, low cost SDN devices. The main objective will be to find out how well they can perform in small or medium scale networks. In order to accomplish our goal a simple network was used, in which either of the devices was connected to the controller and two hosts. The controller used was Ryu, running under an Ubuntu machine. For the measurement of statistics command line tools from both Ubuntu and OpenFlow were used. One special motivation for the development of this paper is the fact that these devices have not been analyzed in terms of performance. Through the development of this paper we show that the Raspberry PI can be used adequately as a SDN switch. Neither the Zodiac FX nor the Raspberry PI can reach the capacity that the vendors published. And interestingly in terms of bandwidth the Raspberry PI can under certain circumstances have better results than a non SDN conventional CISCO Catalyst switch. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In today's generation, our busy lives have been totally automated, which simplifies things and attracts people to automated systems, which minimize human labour, putting less effort, time, and errors due to human carelessness. This system is completely supported voice-based, and it employs a Raspberry Pi circuit. It also has an IR sensor, a voice app, a Bluetooth module, jars for holding water, pipes, and a motor. During this project, the voice app detects the person's speech and transmits the appropriate information to the Raspberry Pi 3, which determines whether the water requested by the person should be hot or cold. The raspberry pi uses the information from the IR sensor to determine whether or not the glass is put beneath the pipe. The device employs infrared sensors to detect the presence of a water glass, after which the IR sensor sends a signal to the Raspberry Pi, causing the motor to start and water to flow via the pipes from the real jar (hot/cold). If the glass is not placed, the sensor sends a signal to the motor, which prevents water from flowing through the pipe until the glass is placed. This approach is frequently utilized in reception, offices, homes, and other places where people want hot or cold water by just voicing a command. © 2021 IEEE.},

In addition to this, it is used for detecting the traffic density and gives the traffic report to the travelers. This traffic report is updated periodically and displayed on the screens installed at the public places. These screens can also be used for advertising purposes which is an additional advantage. Using Raspberry Pi one can manage the preference of advertising and displaying traffic report. This installation supports Government by making things digitalized. This also helps in avoiding usage of papers and plastic for advertising. It results in saving environment by reducing plastic usage and also by reducing the deforestation.

	abstract = {Introduction: There is currently substantial interest in dynamic telecytology-the presentation of microscopic findings by live video feed to a cytopathologist at a remote location. However, the initial costs of a telecytology system can be high. We present several low-cost alternatives along with their performance characteristics. Materials and methods: We tested 3 low-cost telecytology systems: a Raspberry Pi with a webcam, an iPhone 4S with FaceTime, and an iPhone 4S with a live streaming app. Costs, resolution capacities, and latency periods for image transmission were determined. Results: At $85.55, the Raspberry Pi system is the least expensive telecytology solution described to date. When the cost per megapixel of resolution is considered, the cost of a Raspberry Pi system is 120× less than the most expensive commercially available option and about 7-fold less than the iPhone-based alternatives. Latency periods were substantially lower for the iPhone systems: 2.5 ± 1 seconds for FaceTime and 2.8 ± 0.3 seconds for iPhone live streaming versus 6.6 ± 0.6 seconds for the Raspberry Pi system at comparable frame rates. Conclusions: This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that inexpensive telecytology systems are able to stream live video feeds of cytology slides from a microscope to a remote location at useable resolutions. © 2014 American Society of Cytopathology.},

	abstract = {The world is currently experiencing a COVID-19 pandemic which has caused many deaths. Then, one of COVID-19 early detection can be done through wearing a face mask and detecting body temperature when entering a room. The purpose of this research is to create an attendance system capable to recognize face, face mask, and measure body temperature. The data was tested against three types of Raspberry Pi (Pi 3B, Pi 4-4Gb, and Pi 4-8Gb). Each type of Raspberry Pi was tested using three metric combinations of different encoding methods and object classification, namely Method 1 - Haar Cascade and LBPH, Method 2 - Haar Cascade, and Tensorflow, Method 3 - MTCNN and Tensorflow. The test results obtained Method 1: FPS 15, accuracy rate 60%, CPU temperature 58°C, Method 2: FPS 4, accuracy rate 90%, CPU temperature 65°C, Method 3: FPS 2, accuracy rate 95%, CPU temperature 68°C. Based on the benchmarks and scoring, it can be concluded that the most optimal attendance system based on face recognition, mask, and body temperature detection is a system with a Raspberry Pi 4-4Gb and Method 1-Haar Cascade and LBPH. For next development, this attendance system needs to be further improved in security and accuracy without increasing CPU load.. © 2021 IEEE.},

The proposed system checks the temperature and moisture content present in the soil. The motor is also automatically controlled ON and OFF, when the 3-phase supply is present in the field and also with the flow of water. The acquired temperature and moisture content of the soil are sent to Raspberry Pi using nRF24L01 transceiver. Raspberry Pi posts the received values on the webpage. When we enter the acquired parameter values in the soil test blogs, the webpage shows the suggestions of pesticides and crops that need to be taken by the farmer to increase the yield.

	abstract = {Real-time human detection is a challenging task due to appearance variance, occlusion and rapidly changing content; therefore it requires efficient hardware and optimized software. This paper presents a real-time human detection scheme on a Raspberry Pi. An efficient algorithm for human detection is proposed by processing regions of interest (ROI) based upon foreground estimation. Different number of scales have been considered for computing Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features for the selected ROI. Support vector machine (SVM) is employed for classification of HOG feature vectors into detected and non-detected human regions. Detected human regions are further filtered by analyzing the area of overlapping regions. Considering the limited capabilities of Raspberry Pi, the proposed scheme is evaluated using six different testing schemes on Town Centre and CAVIAR datasets. Out of these six testing schemes, Single Window with two Scales (SW2S) processes 3 frames per second with acceptable less accuracy than the original HOG. The proposed algorithm is about 8 times faster than the original multi-scale HOG and recommended to be used for real-time human detection on a Raspberry Pi. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been a lot of demand for deep learning models that can operate on a constrained device. When it comes to the task of object detection, EfficientDet is a well-known model. In this study, we use the integer quantization technique to perform real-time object detection on a Raspberry Pi using the popular EfficientDet family. We use the pretrained models from the TensorFlow to perform object detection for a specific task and evaluate their on-device performance. We examined the models' performance in terms of average precision and recall, IOU, speed, and model size. When working on a Raspberry Pi, we discovered that EfficientDet1 after quantization, with a moving average decay of 0.95 and a Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer is a good choice.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The paper discusses the implementation of a time-frequency correlation algorithm for time delay estimation (TDE) on Raspberry Pi single-board computers. The implemented correlation algorithm is based on Fourier transform with the frequency sweep. In the paper, we analyzed the task of real-time acquisition and processing of acoustic signals with the Raspberry Pi computers. Then we modified the algorithm of computation of time frequency-correlation function to be applicable in real-time and implemented it as a C++ object. To increase the performance, we implemented GPU acceleration using GPU_FFT and Vulkan FFT libraries. The first library is a firmware that utilizes VideoCore IV on Raspberry Pi 3B+. Vulkan FFT library was implemented as an alternative compatible with VideoCore VI on Raspberry 4B. To estimate the efficiency of applying the graphical cores to we conducted a set of experiments. Those experiments were designed to measure the reduction in processing time after accelerating the most time computationally operation of inverse Fourier transform with the GPU. According to the results, we have concluded that GPU acceleration is efficient and makes possible the real-time processing of acoustic signals even of Raspberry Pi 3B+. The GPU acceleration proved to be the most crucial when large Fourier transform window size and the significant number of frequency bands are used. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This device included a Raspberry Pi, infrared camera module, MOSFET, infrared LED floodlight, and pyroelectric infrared ray sensor. The operation of the apparatus is as follows: When the pyroelectric infrared sensor is triggered by the presence of an animal and the signal becomes HIGH, a signal of HIGH is output from GPIO of the Raspberry Pi and a voltage of 12 V is applied to the MOSFET to make it function as a relay circuit. The infrared LED projector then lights up. At the same time the device starts taking a still image or video using the infrared camera that is connected to the Raspberry Pi. The apparatus succeeded in shooting a movie of a rat, and it successfully took still pictures. We installed the machine-learning library “TensorFlow” on the Raspberry Pi and performed image recognition of murine images using a deep learning program. When the target animal occupies a small part of the image, the image recognition results tend to be erroneous; however, enlarging the area of interest results in more accurate detection. In addition, erroneous judgment was often made in infrared camera images. The time required for the determination was 15 to 45 seconds for the Pi 3 Model B. These results show that it is possible to create a low-cost pest countermeasure device or robot controlled by a Raspberry Pi, and capable of various responses and input processing. © 2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

	abstract = {A seismograph was designed based on Raspberry Pi. Although comprising 8 channels, the seismograph can be expanded to 16, 24, or 32 channels by using a USB interfacing with a microcontroller. In addition, by clustering more than one Raspberry Pi, the number of possible channels can be extended beyond 32. In this study, we also explored the computational intelligence of Raspberry Pi for running real-time systems and multithreaded algorithms to process raw seismic data. Also integrated into the seismograph is a Huawei MH5000-31 5G module, which provided high-speed internet real-time operations. Other hardware peripherals included a 24 bit ADS1251 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a STM32F407 microcontroller. Real-time data were acquired in the field for ambient noise tomography. An analysis tool called spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) was used to analyze the data, followed by inversion, which revealed the subsurface velocity of the site location. The proposed seismograph is prospective for small, medium, or commercial data acquisition. In accordance with the processing power and stability of Raspberry Pi, which were confirmed in this study, the proposed seismograph is also recommended as a template for developing high-performance computing applications, such as artificial intelligence (AI) in seismology and other related disciplines. © 2022 by the authors.

Automated, low-cost, remote-monitoring hardware can greatly improve both reproducibility and maintenance. Methods and Results: Using a Raspberry Pi computer, open-source software, environmental sensors, and a camera, we developed Growth Monitor pi (GMpi), a cost-effective system for monitoring growth chamber conditions. Coupled with our software, GMPi_Pack, our setup automates sensor readings, photography, and alerts when conditions fall out of range. Conclusions: GMpi offers access to environmental data logging, improving reproducibility of experiments and reinforcing the stability of controlled environmental facilities.

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of an inexpensive testbed for network coding protocols composed of Raspberry Pis. First, we show the performance of random linear network coding primitives on the Raspberry Pi in terms of processing speed and energy consumption under a variety of configuration setups. Our measurements show that processing rates of up to 230 Mbps are possible with the Raspberry Pi. Also, the energy consumption per bit can be as small as 3 nJ/bit, which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the transmission/reception energy use. Surprisingly, overclocking the Raspberry Pi from 700 MHz to 1000 MHz not only produces an increase in processing speed of up to 68 % for large generation sizes, but also provides a reduction of 64 % in the processing energy per bit for most tested scenarios. Then, we show Raspberry Pi as an inexpensive, viable, and flexible platform to deploy large research networking testbeds for the evaluation of network coding protocols. We propose key parameters and representations to evaluate protocol performance in network nodes as well as validating the testbed's statistics using the case of a one-hop broadcast with random linear network coding, which is well understood in theory. © 2014 IEEE.},

The Raspberry Pi is a high-performance single-board computer designed to educate and solve real-world problems. This small computer supports a camera module that uses a Sony IMX219 8 megapixel CMOS sensor. This paper shows that scientific and engineering-grade imagery can be produced with the Raspberry Pi 3 and its V2.1 camera module. Raw imagery is shown to be linear with exposure and gain (ISO), which is essential for scientific and engineering applications. Dark frame, noise, and exposure stability assessments along with flat fielding results, spectral response measurements, and absolute radiometric calibration results are described.

There are two ports which available on Raspberry Pi 2 to check and analyze the image sensor effects to the board’s performance. Threading is a solution to improve resource utilization and reduce the image sensor latency when it attach to the embedded board.

	abstract = {Raspberry Pi is employed as a basic embedded system and being a low cost single-board computer, it has emerged to be immensely popular in recent times. This paper mainly deals with natural color of an image including human faces in HSI color space. In this kind of image, it is necessary to describe skin color accurately hence we go on to restore the image based on this criterion. Histogram equalization (HE) is a popular technique for contrast enhancement of images. In order to vary the enhancement degree to get proper skin color, HE with variable enhancement degree (HE-VED) is introduced. The enhancement degree of HE-VED is controlled by intensity and saturation parameter α and β respectively. Dark and low contrast images were captured using the Raspberry Pi camera module and HE-VED was applied to enhance the objective image in a particular enhancement degree automatically with help of Raspberry Pi. Lastly HE-VED was extended to a complete image and appreciable results were obtained which could be further enhanced using different pseudo coloring techniques. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background/Objectives: This paper presents an automatic irrigation system to provide water to the farms based on soil and temperature conditions. It can also control irrigation system through the web application and GSM by using Raspberry pi 2 and 8051 microcontroller. Methods/Statical Analysis: Number of sensor nodes will be placed on farm according to the area of the farm, each sensor node contains temperature sensor, moisture sensor, water level sensor and motor. 8051 microcontroller makes the communication with all sensors placed in the farm and it can collect the parameters like moisture, temperature and water level. Raspberry pi 2 is used to control the web application and GSM modem. Raspberry pi 2 takes data from 8051 microcontroller continuously using a wireless communication device. In this paper ZigBee transceiver is used as a wireless device for transmitting and receiving data from both devices. A threshold value is given for each sensor, if any sensor crosses its threshold value a message will be send to the user and display in web applications. Findings: This system uses Raspberry pi 2 for achieving high speed of operation. In real time farms which are remote areas, this system uses 8051 controller for collecting data from sensors and transfer it to Raspberry pi 2 using wireless sensor device. This system controls the motor automatically when soil or temperature crosses its threshold and manually whenever user wants. Conclusion: This irrigation system works efficiently and speeds. This system sends message to the users whenever sensors exceed its threshold value. This system offers every user to understand the soil conditions and amenable manually.},

Prior work on lowering the cost of cyber ranges focuses on open source solutions and virtual machines. Yet, these solutions do not reduce the cost of physical components - namely, the underlying hardware used to build the range. In this paper, we describe a prototype cyber range built out of Raspberry Pis, a type of inexpensive single board computer. To illustrate the functionality of the range, we use Docker and Docker Swarm to deploy a vulnerable web server across four Raspberry Pi nodes and assess it in an undergraduate classroom. Our cyber range costs under $250.00 to build and consumes less than 25 Watts of power. We open-source our materials and provide pre-built Docker images on Docker Hub to enable others to use our work. Our results suggest that cyber ranges built using Raspberry Pi clusters can lower cost and enhance cyber security education. © 2020 Public Domain.},

In this poster, we assess the feasibility of a Raspberry Pi sensor network for wildlife detection and monitoring. While technology for wildlife observation such as camera traps exist, they are expensive and/or require human intervention to collect the data. An inexpensive sensor network that can take pictures of wildlife with negligible human intervention will enable scientists and military personnel to discretely detect the presence of endangered wildlife. Each raspberry pi sensor node collects data for transmission to a remote user via an android app interface. In order to improve battery efficiency, the system features an adaptable network with four distinct sleep modes. We also explore increasing the range and durability of the network by integrating a mesh network. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Common Lights, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), fans, and other electronic devices are among the appliances that can be used in this system. A smartphone app is designed that helps the user to design the smart home to his actual home via easy and interactive drag & drop option. The system provides control over the appliances via both the local network and remote access. Data logging over the Microsoft Azure cloud database ensures system recovery in case of gateway failure and data record for lateral use. Periodical notifications also help the user to optimize the usage of home appliances. Moreover, the user can set his preferences and the appliances are auto turned off and on to meet user-specific requirements. Raspberry Pi acting as the server maintains the database of each appliance. HTTP web interface and apache server are used for communication between the android app and raspberry pi. With a 5v relay circuit and micro-processor Raspberry Pi, the proposed system is low-cost, energy-efficient, easy to operate, and affordable for low-income houses. © 2020 Ashraf et al.

The storing and processing of the obtained weather data is done in cloud to predicting the effect of this weather change. The system is designed to effectively monitor the ambient weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and rainfall etc. The objective is to design a system which is low cost, requires less maintenance, and involved minimal manual intervention. The system is built using commodity hardware Raspberry Pi, various sensors and uses WiFi as a communication medium which makes the system consume very low power and low cost of building. Smaller Raspberry Pi Zero W boards are used to collect the sensor's data and send it to the base station Raspberry Pi 3 board. The Raspberry Pi 3 then further transmits the data over WiFi to the cloud database and this data is further used to train new Machine Learning model deployed in the cloud for prediction of the effect and to observe and study various weather patterns and trends. The users can access the weather data and insights remotely, and in real time through a web application that is built using the Django Framework, and is deployed in the cloud. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, human beings have increasingly adopted different types of personal computers including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smart phones. More recently, there has been the emergence of the Raspberry Pi and since its release in 2012, this new type of computer has undergone rapid growth in adoption to even become the fastest selling British computer. The Raspberry Pi has often been referred as a computer designed to change the world since it is capable to do most things that a desktop computer can do. The growing concern is that all these computers utilize power in order to operate thereby turning ICT into a power drainer. The diverse functionalities present in modern computers including communication and web browsing, among others, were found to be important components that affect the power consumption of such devices. As such, this paper investigates how power consumption of the Raspberry Pi is affected by the key functionalities that could be performed by end-users on the platform. Moreover, this relationship is compared against other types of common personal computers before recommending on techniques and practices that could reduce the power consumption of this emerging type of computer. © 2016 IEEE.},

The solution to dealing with this problem is building Ad-hoc Network (Manet) technology for communication media. By building alternative VoIP-based communication on Raspberry Pi. The protocol used in VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) based communication using Raspberry Pi is the SOLSR (Secure Optimized Link State Routing) protocol. The VoIP work system is voice passing through the internet network in the VoIP system workflow; two components are connected, the VoIP client and VoIP server, VoIP server as the center. On the VoIP, the server uses Raspberry Pi, and the client also uses Raspberry Pi and is registered via SIP to the server to communicate to other clients and test its performance utilizing QOS testing using SOLSR. The test scenario is done by measuring throughput, delay, jitter, packet loss. The measurement results will produce the performance of a VoIP-based communication system using the SOLSR protocol and determine the feasibility of the SOLSR protocol to be applied to a VoIP-based communication system for disaster management. © 2021 IEEE.},

Emergencies that require urgent rescue, such as searching for survivors in earthquake ruins, can be solved using through-wall radar, which is of great significance to improve urgent rescue capabilities and secure the safety of citizens. Based on micro radar designing method, embedded systems and signal processing technology, this paper proposed a handheld through-wall radar detection device, which is based on Raspberry Pi and characterized by low power consumption, miniaturization, high operability and intuitive display. The device consists of the following parts: Antenna, transmitter and receiver (transceiver), Raspberry pi, monitor and power supply. The experiment results indicate that the system can measure the real-time distance between the wall and human target behind and display the one-dimensional distance image on software screen. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Premise of the Study: Image-based phenomics is a powerful approach to capture and quantify plant diversity. However, commercial platforms that make consistent image acquisition easy are often cost-prohibitive. To make high-throughput phenotyping methods more accessible, low-cost microcomputers and cameras can be used to acquire plant image data. Methods and Results: We used low-cost Raspberry Pi computers and cameras to manage and capture plant image data. Detailed here are three different applications of Raspberry Pi–controlled imaging platforms for seed and shoot imaging. Images obtained from each platform were suitable for extracting quantifiable plant traits (e.g., shape, area, height, color) en masse using open-source image processing software such as PlantCV. Conclusions: This protocol describes three low-cost platforms for image acquisition that are useful for quantifying plant diversity. When coupled with open-source image processing tools, these imaging platforms provide viable low-cost solutions for incorporating high-throughput phenomics into a wide range of research programs.

	abstract = {With the popularity of unlocking and payment of using the face-swiping function, the era of face recognition has arrived. However, the current face recognition technology can identify the identity of the face image but cannot accurately distinguish the authenticity of the input face on embedded devices. Recently, face recognition with face presentation attack detection has become a research hotspot. In this paper, we develop an intelligent face recognition system on Raspberry Pi to handle this issue. Specifically, we first add a face presentation attack detection process to form a three-stage face recognition method to realize face recognition with face anti-spoofing. Second, we select a face detection model, a face presentation attack detection model and a face recognition model suitable for Raspberry Pi, and transplant these models previously trained in the Python environment to the C++ environment. Then we integrate and deploy these three models on Raspberry Pi and use the NCNN inference framework for efficient reasoning within limited memory and computing resources. Finally, we implement the face recognition system and conduct real-world tests to verify the performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our system can be applied in practice, and can achieve good effects.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {IP-PBX have grown considerably in the telecoms and IT industries in recent times due to their low cost, high customizability, open source and hardware-independent nature. Unlike traditional PBX systems that are TDM-based and require a separate wired infrastructure to operate, an IP PBX can be attached to the local LAN and uses SIP with RTP over Internet Protocol (IP) for signaling and data transport, respectively. Asterisk-based IP PBX has become a de facto standard for open-source low-to-medium calling capacity requirements. Single Board Computers (SBCs) are attracting considerable attention from academics, hobbyists and the industry, due to their compact size, low cost, low power, portability and fair processing ability. Raspberry Pi series SBCs are the pioneer in the field, having Pi, Pi2, Pi3 and Pi Zero in production, supporting different processing and storage capabilities. An IP PBX embedded on the raspberry Pi SBC can serve an adequate number of users and provide a tiny platform that can fit in a pocket and be transported anywhere while preserving the functionality of a complete IP PBX. Such systems can be phenomenally successful in situations where large infrastructures cannot be taken, for instance, in warzones or disaster-affected areas where communication networks are damaged, necessitating an immediate requirement for an ad hoc-based communication system. In this paper, we aim to explore the performance of an Asterisk®-based IP PBX installed on a Raspberry Pi 3 (model B) platform in terms of concurrent call handling using different codecs. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is made up of many devices, platforms, and communication protocols. Among them, Raspberry Pi has arisen as one of the most popular equipment for hobby and education purposes because of its low cost, small size, flexibility, and potential. Nevertheless, Raspberry Pi needs an operating system to work, which exposes it to software vulnerabilities despite the many advantages it provides in comparison with nonoperating system devices. This device also has hardware limitations, which impact on its security. These limitations exist because some concessions had to be done during the design in order to decrease the cost of the device. This article analyzes different hardware and software vulnerabilities that can be found in a Raspberry Pi when using a default installation of different available operating systems. Finally, we propose a list of good practices to minimize the presented issues. © 2012 IEEE.},

One of the most sought-after characteristics of on-board sensors is the low costing associated to good quality of the collected data. This paper proposes a very low-cost multiband sensor developed on a Raspberry device and two Raspberry Pi 3 cameras that can be used in photogrammetry from drone applications. The UAV-integrated radiometric sensor and its performance were tested in in two villages of South-west Niger for the detection of temporary surface water bodies (or Ephemeral water bodies): zones of seasonal stagnant water within villages threatening the viability and people's health. The Raspberry Pi 3 cameras employed were a regular RGB Pi camera 2 (Red, Green, Blue) and a NoIR Pi 3 camera v2 (regular RGB without IR filter) with 8MPX resolution. The cameras were geometrically calibrated and radiometrically tested before the survey in the field. The results of the photogrammetry elaborations were 4 orthophotos (a RGB and NoIRGB orthophoto for each village). The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was calculated. The index allowed the localization and the contouring of the temporary surface water bodies present in the villages. The data were checked against the data collected with a Sony (ILCE-5100). Very high correspondence between the different data was detected. Raspberry-based sensors demonstrated to be a valid tool for the data collection in critical areas. © Authors 2019.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices generate data at high speed and large volume. Often the data require real-time processing to support high system responsiveness which can be supported by localised Cloud and/or Fog computing paradigms. However, there are considerably large deployments of IoT such as sensor networks in remote areas where Internet connectivity is sparse, challenging the localised Cloud and/or Fog computing paradigms. With the advent of the Raspberry Pi, a credit card-sized single board computer, there is a great opportunity to construct low-cost, low-power portable cloud to support real-time data processing next to IoT deployments. In this paper, we extend our previous work on constructing Raspberry Pi Cloud to study its feasibility for real-time big data analytics under realistic application-level workload in both native and virtualised environments. We have extensively tested the performance of a single node Raspberry Pi 2 Model B with httperf and a cluster of 12 nodes with Apache Spark and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Our results have demonstrated that our portable cloud is useful for supporting real-time big data analytics. On the other hand, our results have also unveiled that overhead for CPU-bound workload in virtualised environment is surprisingly high, at 67.2%. We have found that, for big data applications, the virtualisation overhead is fractional for small jobs but becomes more significant for large jobs, up to 28.6%. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {A wireless impedance monitoring system, called SSeL-Pi, is designed to have cheap, mobile, and handy practical features as compared to wired commercial impedance analyzers. A Raspberry Pi platform impedance sensor node is designed to measure signals at a low-frequency range of up to 100 kHz. The low-frequency impedance measurement via the proposed node has been combined with a new PZT interface technique for measuring local responses sensitive to structural damage. The new PZT interface can work as a surface-mounted or embedded sensor, and its local dynamic characteristics are numerically analyzed to pre-determine an effective impedance resonant frequency range of less than 100 kHz. Next, a software scheme was designed to visualize the input/output parameters of the proposed SSeL-Pi system (i.e., Raspberry Pi platform and PZT interface) and automate signal acquisition procedures of the impedance sensor node. The calibration for impedance signals obtained from the proposed system was performed by a series of procedures, from acquiring real and imaginary impedance to adjusting them with respect to a commercial impedance analyzer (HIOKI-3532). The feasibility of the wireless impedance monitoring system was experimentally evaluated for PZT interfaces that were subjected to various compressive loadings. The consistent results analyzed from signals measured by the SSeL-Pi and HIOKI 3532 systems were observed. Additionally, the strong relationships between impedance features (frequency shift and RMSD index) and compressive stresses of the PZT interfaces showed the potential for axial force/stress variation monitoring in real structures using the Raspberry Pi platform impedance sensor node and developed PZT interface. © 2022 by the authors.},

It allows high-level control algorithms, wireless communication, and computationally expensive operations such as real-time image processing to be handled by a Raspberry Pi, while the e-puck's microcontroller deals with low-level motor control and sensor interfacing. Although two similar extension boards for the e-puck robot platform already exist, they are now out-dated and expensive in comparison. Our open-source hardware design and supporting software infrastructure offer an inexpensive upgrade to the e-puck robot, transforming it into the Pi-puck - a modern and flexible new platform for mobile robotics research. © 2017 IEEE.},

The current hospital centric healthcare system is becoming inefficient to treat conditions that demand immediate treatment such as heart strokes. So, the focus is now tilting from hospital centric treatment to patient centric treatment. This project proposes a health monitoring system which monitors vital parameters of the patient such as temperature and heart rate using sensors as well as a fitbit which are connected to a raspberry pi board. The project involves alerting the doctor through SMS if any vital parameter of the patient deviates from the normal value. Apart from helping the doctor monitor the patient's basic health parameters this health monitoring system also ensures that the patient takes the prescribed medication at the right times. The raspberry pi acts as a personal server which logs the details of the patient's medication. The patient is sent reminders to take medicines through SMS according to his prescription. © 2017 IEEE.},

Hence it is very important to manage electricity efficiently. In this regard one of the major challenges in electricity management is misuse of the power consumption due to electricity theft in public area. In this paper we propose a technique that detects the electricity theft by remotely monitoring the electricity meter readings to see whether it is within the specified threshold value and thus minimizing the misuse of electric power consumption in public areas. It also aims in the reduction of manual workload by tracking the data automatically. The paper mainly focuses on the implementation of the concept using Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying framework to achieve real time monitoring through Raspberry pi board. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In today's modern world, mechanical strength is just one of the many criteria that determine the superiority of any boiler. There are many other more important aspects such as efficiency, 24-hour availability, ease of maintenance, environmental compliance, etc. Modern high-pressure boilers that are equipped with areas optimized for heat transfer due to its nominal load require some of the important operating parameters to be carefully checked to maintain constant production. Thought instrumentation is a very broad topic to discuss, this document highlights some of the tools and control circuits necessary for safe, economical and reliable operation of boilers. In this research project we are monitoring and controlling six important parameters with which the output of the process will be stable. Here we are using parameters sensors: oxygen sensor, humidity sensor, flow sensor, current sensor. This project uses the RASPBERRY PI microcontroller, the output of the sensors produces the analog signal, this signal directly connected to the Raspberry pi microcontroller. The controlled parameters tend to stabilize ensuring the quality of the process in the boiler. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {Interconnection of number of devices through internet is defined as Internet of Things (IoT). This IoT technology eliminates the human intervention in controlling of devices. Smart Irrigation is the process of supplying water to the fields in a smart way that reduces the water wastage and increases the water use efficiency. This paper proposed a design of an IoT based smart irrigation system to the fields using raspberry pi 3, arduino controllers, Wi-Fi module along with motors and soil moisture sensors. Also an android application called “blynk app” is integrated in this proposed system. Based on the moisture level of the field and weather report from raspberry pi the system will detect the sufficient water supplying time and supply appropriate amount of water to the field. The arduino controllers will transmit analog data received from sensor to raspberry pi as digital data. To connect raspberry pi and arduino a particular communication mode is provided. If any water shortage occurs in the field then this system inform that as a notification to the user through blynk app. This app allows user to manually control the system. By using this system water usage efficiency is obtained as 90% and system cost is reduced up to 2/3rd than that of drip irrigation system. This proposed system has best use in seasonal crop fields with a perfect water management. © Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

First, we highlight the required changes in the configuration of the Pi to gain performance. Second, we explore how limited memory bandwidth limits the use of all cores in our shared memory benchmarks. Third, we evaluate whether low network bandwidth affects distributed performance. Fourth, we discuss the power consumption and the resulting trade-off in cost of operation and performance.  © 2020 IEEE.},

The first step concerns the synthesis of the fuzzy neural controller, and in the second step, we present the control scheme synthesized on the Simulink environment, in order to control the position of the inverted pendulum.

	abstract = {Space studying has become one of the most informative and popular areas of the new era. Monitoring the space and studying its phenomena was started a long way back. To make the study cheaper and more portable, the Stanford SOLAR Center first presented with a Space Weather Monitoring program called the sudden ionospheric monitors (SID). This monitoring system was used to monitor the Earth's ionosphere changes, which affected the very low frequency (VLF) radio propagations. This low cost but sensitive detection system is used all around the globe via various modifications. This paper presents the monitoring system's design and implementation using Raspberry Pi for a smaller and compact base with less power usage and higher sensitivity. Raspberry Pi will be used as the base platform connected to a loop antenna and preamplifier. The acquisition system was written in a Python platform and ran through a Linux system. As a result, an efficient and more portable VLF data acquisition system to detect sudden ionospheric disturbance using Raspberry Pi has been developed. The developed version was able to detect a monitor frequency transmitted from NWC-Australia (19.8kHz), Australia, and VTX3-India (18.2 kHz). © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Technology is a double-edged sword when it changes the way we perform everyday activities for the better. Unfortunately, misfits will always find new ways to misuse technology to facilitate their misdeeds. CCTV are great security measures that can be used to catch culprits in action, but other than banks, hospitals, shopping malls, academic institutes etc., a CCTV solution is beyond most household budgets and require continuous monitoring. Because mobile phones are the primary hand-held device, it is only logical to integrate these with a CCTV solution. Motion Detection Security System Notifier using Raspberry Pi with Telegram is as the name suggests. Using Raspberry Pi, a motion detection system is developed through the method of background subtraction, which works by subtracting the static from the background frame from the constantly changing foreground. The change of value in noise and pixel density between the background frame and the foreground indicates motion. Each time a motion is detected, the system will automatically send the frame to the user via Telegram to notify that there has been movement in the area as captured in the frames. A prototype is first developed in a virtual environment using VirtualBox software before running it on the Raspberry Pi. This paper will show the relevance of the project.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In India, a large number of population depend upon agriculture for their livelihood. The ground water levels have come down drastically due to decrease in rainfall and increase in global warming. In the conventional irrigation techniques, farmer has to go to the field regularly for checking the condition of the crops and for watering it. With the improvements in digital and communication technologies, automatic irrigation systems have come into existence. In this paper, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based Automatic Irrigation and Security System using Raspberry Pi is implemented. In the proposed system, Raspberry Pi is used as a Coordinator node (CR node), Arduino as End node device, and nRF24L01 transceiver is used for wireless communication and data transfer between the CR node and end node. Each Arduino node collects the various sensor inputs such as soil moisture, temperature, PIR sensor status sends them wirelessly to Raspberry Pi. Based on the sensor parameters and soil status, the water pump is turned on and the various sensor node values are posted on the webpage using Raspberry Pi web server. Farmer can monitor the status of the field on the webpage. Also, there is an option to turn ON/OFF the water pump manually from the webpage. The PIR sensor and a buzzer are used to protect the crop from the cattle entering the field. The system can reduce the water consumption and wastage of water to the crop. It results in increasing yield and more profit to the farmer. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We present our ongoing work building a Raspberry Pi cluster consisting of 300 nodes. The unique characteristics of this single board computer pose several challenges, but also offer a number of interesting opportunities. On the one hand, a single Raspberry Pi can be purchased cheaply and has a low power consumption, which makes it possible to create an affordable and energy-efficient cluster. On the other hand, it lacks in computing power, which makes it difficult to run computationally intensive software on it. Nevertheless, by combining a large number of Raspberries into a cluster, this drawback can be (partially) offset. Here we report on the first important steps of creating our cluster: how to set up and configure the hardware and the system software, and how to monitor and maintain the system. We also discuss potential use cases for our cluster, the two most important being an inexpensive and green test bed for cloud computing research and a robust and mobile data center for operating in adverse environments. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robotic applications, such as educational programs, are well-known. Nonetheless, there are challenges to be implemented in other settings, e.g., mine detection, agriculture support, and tasks for industry 4.0. The main challenge consists of robotic operations supported by autonomous decision using sensed-based features extraction. A prototype of a robot assembled using mechanical parts of a LEGO MINDSTORMS Robotic Kit EV3 and a Raspberry Pi controlled through servo algorithms of 2D and 2D1/2 vision approaches was implemented to tackle this challenge. This design is supported by simulations based on image, position, and a hybrid scheme for visual servo controllers. Practical implementation is operated using navigation guided by running up image-based visual servo control algorithms embedded in a Raspberry Pi that uses a control criterion based on error evolution to compute the difference between a target and sensed image. Images are collected by a camera installed on a mobile robotic platform manually and automatically operated and controlled using the Raspberry Pi. An Android application to watch the images by video streaming is shown here, using a smartphone and a video related to the implemented robot’s operation. This kind of robot might be used to complete field reactive tasks in the settings mentioned above, since the detection and control approaches allow self-contained guidance. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is a production machine performance measurement system. Performance measurement with OEE consists of three main parameters in the production machine, namely Availability (machine availability time), Performance (number of units produced) and Quality (quality produced). Many OEE monitoring modules are on the market. These modules are still very expensive so most companies are still unable to implement OEE into production machines. In this research, a software called OEEMAX which functions for OEE monitoring has been developed to be installed on Raspberry Pi. OEEMAX was built to be able to run on Raspberry and be able to read inputs from sensors. OEEMAX is also able to communicate with all types of Programmable Logic Control (PLC). The advantage of Raspberry Pi is the price of the module which is very cheap and uses open source operating system. OEEMAX has been successfully developed and applied to Raspberry Pi. It is able to read sensors through general purpose input / output (GPIO) and communicate with PLC using RS-232 protocol. In addition, it is also capable to send OEE data to SQL server. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The result proved the potential of Raspberry PI for the design of a compact, affordable, and medically safe measurement device.

This summer camp focused its efforts on teaching incoming 8th-grade female students the fundamentals of programming skills and engineering concepts. We taught our camp participants to use Raspberry Pi to build systems that explore fundamental programming and engineering concepts and develop engineering skills. Raspberry Pi provides a general programming environment with numerous interfaces to allow direct control of the hardware. This paper describes the organization, coordination, and core curriculum instructions that integrate programming and engineering concepts taught in each hands-on session and discusses the program assessment results. Our program assessment results showed that all camp participant cohorts increased their knowledge and interests in computing and engineering.

	abstract = {With the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing, which are technologies that rely on smart and low power computing nodes with adequate processing power and storage capabilities, it is expected that Artificial Intelligence and machine learning will play a role in the continuous spreading of their application fields. One of the most adopted hardware platforms for IoT and Machine Learning is the low-cost, multipurpose Raspberry Pi, which is small enough and still capable of effectively handling machine learning tasks. Moreover, it is ideal for development and educational purposes. On the other hand, among the plethora of Machine Learning (ML) paradigms reported in the literature, we identified Rulex [1] as a good candidate as an ML engine, suitable for advanced edge computing applications. In this paper, we report the deployment of the machine learning package Rulex to operate on the Raspberry Pi in multiple arrangements. The target is to perform training and testing of Machine Learning algorithms through running Rulex on the Raspberry PI as an Edge Computing Device. Specifically, we describe the process of porting Rulex external and internal libraries on Windows 32 Bits, Ubuntu 64 Bits, and Raspbian 32 Bits. Moreover, we present the standalone and Client/Server Configuration of Rulex on the Raspberry Pi along with the Remote Development configuration used to compile and debug the Rulex source code remotely. We have applied Forecasts using training and testing data sets on the Raspberry Pi as an IoT Device, which generate promising and accurate results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {With the advances in systems-on-a-chip technologies, there is a growing demand to deploy intelligent vision systems on low-cost microcomputers. To address this challenge, much of the recent research has focused on reducing the model size and computational complexity of contemporary convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The state-of-the-art lightweight CNN is MobileNetV3. However, it was designed to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and latency on a single large core of a Google Pixel 1 smartphone. Accordingly, MobileNetV3 is not optimized for platforms with different hardware characteristics and its predecessors may perform better for a given target platform. The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to analyze the performance of different compact CNNs on Raspberry Pi 4; 2) to manually adapted the most promising models to better utilize the Raspberry Pi 4 hardware. After exploring a number of modifications, we present a new CNN architecture, namely MobileNetV3-Small-Pi, which is 36% faster and slightly more accurate on ImageNet classification compared to the baseline MobileNetV3-Small. © 2021 The Authors.

Even though the technology warns the user about the detected traffic sign, there are chances that the user might violate them, and violating the traffic sign rules might lead to accidents where the life of people would be at stake. Hence, to avoid these problems this project has proposed a prototype in such a way that, it detects the traffic signs using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and acts accordingly denying the user's control in real time if he tries to violate the rules in the traffic sign. The prototype contains a Remote Controlled (RC) car, which is controlled with Raspberry pi-3 with a pi camera and Arduino. The live feed from the pi camera is fed into Raspberry pi-3 which detects the traffic signs (speed limit, no left, no right, no U-turn). The Arduino UNO is used to drive the motor according to the processed output from the Raspberry pi-3. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Abduction, swapping and mix-ups are the unfortunate events that could happen to newborn while in hospital premises and medical personnel are finding it difficult to curb this unfortunate incident. Traditional methods like birth ID bracelets and offline footprint recognition systems have their own drawbacks. Hence, a neonatalonline personal authentication system is proposed for this issue based on multimodal biometric system wherein footprint and palm print of neonatal is used for recognition. This concept is further enhanced by developing a prototype to be implemented on a Raspberry Pi 2 (a single board computer). In this paper, SIFT feature extraction, RANSAC algorithm for identification of matched interest points of palm print and footprint biometrics using OpenCV on Raspberry pi is implemented. The Raspberry Pi is a quad core ARM Cortex A7 application processor, System on chip (SoC) denoted as Broadcom BCM2836. It enhances performance, consumes less power, and reduces overall system cost and size. The Raspberry Pi is been controlled by a modified version of Debian Linux OS optimized for ARM architecture. The image recognition is performed using open source OpenCV-3.1.0 in Linux platform using CMake, g++, makefile. Thereby the proposed system improves the security system in hospitals / birth centers and provides a low cost solution to the newborn swapping rather than the expensive DNA and HLA(Human Leukocyte Antigen)typing procedures.The efficiency(97.2%) is high when multimodality is used than unimodality.

The distance estimation is done with the help of rotation encoder with MOC 7811 IC with the pulse counting circuit placed at one of the wheelchair motors. The comparative study shows that in terms of controlling extra hardware the better performer is the Arduino platform as compared to the Raspberry Pi platform, whereas for compiling bigger algorithms Raspberry Pi is better.

	abstract = {Within the context of cloud computing, efficient resource management is of great importance as it can result in higher scalability and significant energy and cost reductions over time. Because of the high complexity and costs of cloud environments, however, newly developed resource allocation strategies are often only validated by means of simulations, for example, by using CloudSim or custom-developed simulation tools. This article describes a general approach for the validation of cloud resource allocation strategies, illustrating the importance of experimental validation on physical testbeds. Furthermore, the design and implementation of Raspberry Pi as a Service (RPiaaS), a low-cost embedded testbed built using Raspberry Pi nodes, is presented. RPiaaS aims to facilitate the step from simulations toward experimental evaluations on larger cloud testbeds and is designed using a microservice architecture, where experiments and all required management services are running inside containers. The performance of the RPiaaS testbed is evaluated using several benchmark experiments. The obtained results not only illustrate that the overhead of both using containers and running the required RPiaaS services is minimal but also provide useful insights for scaling up experiments between the Raspberry Pi testbed and a larger more traditional cloud testbed. The introduced validation approach is then illustrated using a case study focusing on the allocation of hierarchically structured tenant data. The results obtained through simulations are compared to the experimental results. The RPiaaS testbed proved to be a very useful tool for the initial experimental validation before moving the experiments to a large-scale testbed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

In contrast, we exploit mmWave technology in designing high-density IoT networks, where there are hundreds of nodes, but each requiring only a Mbps wireless link. However, existingmmWave radios are costly and have high power consumption which makes them unsuitable for IoT sensors. We have built mmPi: A low-cost and low-power mmWave radio that operates as a daughterboard for the Raspberry Pi platform. We believe that mmPi helps advance mmWave research in the IoT domain. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

This paper proposes an IoT-based system where rice stocks in orphanages can be detected by Raspberry pi which is connected to sensors, data information from raspberry-pi connected to the network that can be accessed and monitored by mobile applications. This application designed for service providers, donors and rice suppliers. Donors send rice through financial transactions with service providers, and rice suppliers will ship items to the orphanage.

	abstract = {Playbacks of visual or audio stimuli to wild animals is a widely used experimental tool in behavioral ecology. In many cases, however, playback experiments are constrained by observer limitations such as the time observers can be present, or the accuracy of observation. These problems are particularly apparent when playbacks are triggered by specific events, such as performing a specific behavior, or are targeted to specific individuals. We developed a low-cost automated playback/recording system, using two field-deployable devices: radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and Raspberry Pi micro-computers. This system detects a specific passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag attached to an individual, and subsequently plays back the stimuli, or records audio or visual information. To demonstrate the utility of this system and to test one of its possible applications, we tagged female and male tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) from two box-nesting populations with PIT tags and carried out playbacks of nestling begging calls every time focal females entered the nestbox over a six-hour period. We show that the RFID-Raspberry Pi systempresents a versatile, low-cost, field-deployable system that can be adapted for many audio and visual playback purposes. In addition, the set-up does not require programming knowledge, and it easily customized to many other applications, depending on the research questions. Here, we discuss the possible applications and limitations of the system. The low cost and the small learning curve of the RFID-Raspberry Pi system provides a powerful new tool to field biologists. © 2015 Lendvai et al.},

Firstly, six kinds of road surfaces data are collected by utilizing Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and MPU 9250. Secondly, the classifiers can be obtained by adopting several machine learning algorithms, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. Among the machine learning classifiers, gradient boosting decision tree has the highest accuracy rate of 97.92%, which improves by 29.52% compared with KNN with the lowest accuracy rate of 75.60%. The accuracy rate of LSTM neural networks is 95.31%, which improves by 2.79% compared with RNN with the accuracy rate of 92.52%. Finally, the classifiers are embedded into the Raspberry Pi to detect the road surface in real time, and the detection time is about one second. This road surface detection system could be used in wheeled robot-car and guiding the robot-car to move smoothly. © The Author(s) 2021.},

The web page has video screen for surveillance and buttons to control robot and camera. For proper surveillance at night, a night vision camera has been implemented. The web page is the command control center for the robot, which can be run in both computer and mobile phone (IOS/Android). The signal, which is generated from web page, are sent to Raspberry pi through Wi-Fi and Raspberry pi receives these signals according to Shell Script written in Raspberry pi. Therefore, the commands are processed and the robot is directed with user directive. The Video Streaming is done using MJPG streamer program that gets MJPEG data and the movement of the robot is controlled by Shell Script which sends it through a HTTP session.

The paper proposed an instructional design that allowed mechatronics projects to advanced into cyber-physical systems. The in-class lectures were provided at minimal; students were encouraged to learn from the user community. The experiential learning was provided by exercises using kits with compatible peripheral devices as well as student-initiated projects. Written exams were used to assess the theory while the exercises and projects confirmed the same contents experientially. The proposed instruction design mitigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second half of the course. A remotely-operated rig was developed with Raspberry Pi for the hands-on exercises. The projects were completed at home. The written exam was conducted online with a newly developed exam room feature in the Courseville LMS with open-ended questions that were designed to test the basic competency and advanced understanding. The resilience of the proposed instructional design overcame challenges from the pandemic with the newly developed tools on the Raspberry Pi platform; students were able to master knowledge, and skills satisfactorily. © 2020 IEEE.},

This paper proposes a directional control system based on human eye tracking strategy using a mobile application. The introduced system can control any electric device power or the movement direction for the mobile objects, such as cars, robots, and wheelchairs. The proposed mobile application, which applied to an Android smartphone, detects and tracks the human eye depending on Viola-Jones based Haar-liked features cascade classifiers algorithm. Ultimately, it estimate the eye movement direction and the blinking action. The control system includes Raspberry Pi III, which control the ON/OFF of five LEDs connected to it representing the four eye movement directions and the blinking action. The detected eye actions by the mobile application are transferred via a wireless channel (Wi-Fi) to the Raspberry Pi for controlling.

	abstract = {This study proposes a Raspberry Pi-based system for the diagnosis of heart valve diseases as a primary tool to improve the diagnostic accuracy of physicians. The proposed system is able to detect and classify nine common valvular heart cases encompassing eight types of heart valve diseases as well as the normal case of valves. The design and development of the proposed system are mainly divided into two phases, namely development of a disease classification approach, and design and implementation of the diagnostic hardware system. The developed disease classification approach is comprised of five stages, namely obtaining phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, preprocessing, segmentation using a proposed automatic algorithm, feature extraction in three domains (time, frequency, and wavelet decomposition domains) and classification using a backpropagation neural network. The hardware of the diagnostic system consists of a PCG signal acquisition module connected to a processing and displaying unit, which is represented by a Raspberry Pi connected to a touch screen. Where the developed disease classification approach is implemented in the software of the Raspberry Pi to enable it to detect the diseases in real time and fully automatically. The proposed system was clinically tested on 50 real subjects encompassing the nine cases. The performance of the diagnostic system is obtained with an accuracy of 96%, sensitivity of 95.23%, and specificity of 100%. © 2021 The Author(s).

Under the conditions of Cuba, it is impossible to acquire such a device, which costs between $ 600 and $ 3500 USD. Using a Raspberry Pi, its camera module with a CMOS sensor and a unipolar stepper motor (recovered from a discontinued matrix printer) we have built a sky camera for less than $ 300 USD. The Raspberry Pi, using free software and hardware, will control and conduct the operation of the camera, the image capturing, the processing and the transmission of the latter results. Among the advantages provided for this device stand objectively determining the percentages of sky covered by clouds, the ability to archive images taken for potential future reprocessing, the classifications of clouds according to the attenuation of solar radiation they produce, among others. All this advantages will be achieved with an instrument of very low cost, allowing access to this technology for both research networks and meteorological services in poor countries.},

	abstract = {Software Defined Radio (SDR) has become an increasingly credible alternative solution to solid state radio problems. The practical application of SDR in building a spectrum analyser can be complex and expensive; however, the use of lightweight, cost-effective, low-cost SDR and lowpower microprocessors can significantly reduce the cost. This paper investigates ways to build lightweight, cost-effective spectrum analysers and their most effective design and implementation, utilising the RTL-SDR USB device, a software modelling tool (GNU Radio), and a low-power-microprocessor Raspberry Pi. The RTL-SDR USB device, GNU Radio Software and Raspberry Pi are configured together to produce a lightweight SDR-based spectrum analyser. In this particular implementation, the spectrum analyser is used to examine a small section of the electromagnetic spectrum to test the suitability of the configuration for complex Fast Fourier Transform calculations. For comparison purposes, another spectrum analyser is built using a more powerful microprocessor (AMD Turion), and the results recorded and compared. The experimental results and comparative evaluation of the two spectrum analysers demonstrate that the Raspberry Pi-based design performs equally well despite its limited resources and low cost. This shows the success and potential of this SDR and Raspberry Pi-based spectrum analyser as a credible device for a number of intelligence analyses applications in a secure environment. © 2017 IEEE.},

One of the main reasons for the congestion is large delay or the time fixed for the red light in the signal. The turnover time of corresponding light is already fixed in the traffic system and it is not based on the number of vehicle on the particular direction. In our idea, we proposed the enhancement of traffic system controller in a road junction using microcontroller. This idea tries to reduce the occurrence of congestion caused by traffic lights, to an extent The proposed idea is based on raspberry-pi. The proposed model contains IR transmitter and IR receiver are fixed at the possible direction on the traffic signal roads. Based on the number of vehicles count, the raspberry decides and controls the traffic signal time duration as a result The vehicle count produced from raspberry data will be recorded. For correct classification, the record details can be stored to the controller by informing raspberry-pi to the computer system then it will send correct delay of signal into the LED lights. In future this model can be used to giving information to travelers about different areas and the traffic condition for the same. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Modern industries require advance monitoring, controlling, and reliable supervision of the various industrial processes. In today’s world, industries use computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) to create an automation process of production systems with the use of computers. Besides the use of CIM, industries also use programmable logic controller (PLC) for industrial automation in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. These systems, i.e., CIM, PLCs are expensive and use specialized advance software which becomes a barrier for most of the medium and small size industries for their automation process. In this survey paper, different authors replaced programmable logic controller (PLC) by Raspberry Pi which is a small computer. Replacing PLC by Raspberry Pi reduces the cost of constructing an automation system and also has its own built-in Wi-Fi, USB, Ethernet, Bluetooth, HDMI, etc. This paper surveys different methods for creating an automation system for the industrial process using various specialized software using SCADA along with Raspberry pi (a low-cost computer which can act as a soft PLC). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The system involves monitoring the air quality by considering parameters like Suspended particulate matter(SPM), Carbon dioxide, Ozone, Carbon monoxide, Smoke, temperature and humidity. Particulate matter being a very important parameter gives a clear indication of pollution in that particular time in the area. These pollutant data are extracted using sensors like MQ7, MQ135, MQ9, DSM501A, DHT11, etc. Most of these sensors produce analog output so an Analog to Digital converter is required before supplying the data to the Raspberry pi 3B+ microcontroller. Using software and coding of the Raspberry Pi 3B+, the data are analyzed and a graph to show the changes in the locality and time in which the experiment is plotted. The results obtained were verified. The experiment is conducted in a locality at Rajarhat, New Town, Kolkata and the results were compared with that from a local environment control authority. This system would help to take real-time decisions and very effective in today's situation of high air pollution in most of the Indian cities. © 2019 IEEE.},

This paper presents a study of an unconventional low-cost energy-efficient HPC cluster composed of Raspberry Pi nodes. The performance, power and energy efficiency obtained from this unconventional platform is compared with a well-known coprocessor used in HPC (Intel Xeon Phi) for two data mining algorithms: Apriori and K-Means. The experimental results showed that the Raspberry Pi cluster can consume up to 88.35% and 85.17% less power than Intel Xeon Phi when running Apriori and K-Means, respectively, and up to 45.51% less energy when running Apriori. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

	abstract = {Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) usage is undoubtedly increasing at a significant rate. However, alongside this expansion is a growing concern that dependable low-cost counter measures do not exist. To mitigate a threat in a restricted airspace, it must first be known that a threat is present. With airport disruption from malicious UASs occurring regularly, low-cost methods for early warning are essential. This paper considers a low-cost early warning system for UAS detection and classification consisting of a BladeRF software-defined radio (SDR), wideband antenna and a Raspberry Pi 4 producing an edge node with a cost of under USD 540. The experiments showed that the Raspberry Pi using TensorFlow is capable of running a CNN feature extractor and machine learning classifier as part of an early warning system for UASs. Inference times ranged from 15 to 28 s for two-class UAS detection and 18 to 28 s for UAS type classification, suggesting that for systems that require timely results the Raspberry Pi would be better suited to act as a repeater of the raw SDR data, enabling the processing to be carried out on a higher powered central control unit. However, an early warning system would likely fuse multiple sensors. These experiments showed the RF machine learning classifier capable of running on a low-cost Raspberry Pi 4, which produced overall accuracy for a two-class detection system at 100% and 90.9% for UAS type classification on the UASs tested. The contribution of this research is a starting point for the consideration of low-cost early warning systems for UAS classification using machine learning, an SDR and Raspberry Pi. © 2022 by the authors.},

Various basic physiological parameters such as blood pressure, heartbeat, oxygen saturation in Blood (SPO2), body temperature and fall detection are measured using relevant sensors and sent to the Arduino microcontroller board for further processing. The computed parameters are then sent to a Raspberry Pi based Web server for display on the web page. ZigBee is used for communication between Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The necessary software is developed using Arduino IDE and Python language. The measured physiological parameters are updated every 60 seconds. The updated parameter values can be viewed from anywhere using an internet enabled device. Also, when the value of the physiological parameters exceeds certain threshold, the caretaker is alerted through SMS. This system is especially helpful for elderly and ill patients. © 2016 IEEE.},

Since its release in 2012, the Raspberry Pi has been infiltrating K-12 education; it has the potential to make coding in K-12 schools as commonplace as textbooks. It has also changed the playing field for hobbyists by offering a low-priced general-purpose computing system that challenges the Arduino in terms of open source support. In this paper, we advocate using the Raspberry Pi (RPi) throughout the University computing curricula as well. Low-priced and portable, the RPi is an exposed hardware platform students can tinker with without fear of breaking. Properly used, it affords students the opportunity to experimentally discover many aspects of computing. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of the RPi that make it appropriate for a University computing curriculum. We describe our classroom experiences and laboratory best practices as well as survey the work of others involved in integrated the RPi into University curriculums. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Single-Board Computers (SBCs) are increasingly used in applications by scientists and hobbyists due to their versatility, affordable prices, reduced energy consumption, small size, and the support of an increasing community. Several manufacturers are now proposing them, but the SBCs of the Raspberry Pi Foundation have been by far more successful. In this paper, an empirical study of the network capabilities of several Raspberry Pi (RPi) models (RPi Zero W, RPi Zero 2 W, RPi 3 Model B, RPi 3 Model B+, and RPi 4 Model B) is done. The performance evaluation is based on benchmarks and several metrics are reported, such as the TCP and UDP throughput, the TCP and UDP round-Trip time, and the performance achieved when transferring files with SSH. In the experiments, a number of parameters are varied, including the network technology (WiFi in the 2.4 GHz band, WiFi in the 5 GHz band, and Ethernet), the network protocol (IPv4 and IPv6), and the TCP and UDP payload. According to the experiments done in this paper, IPv4 has a better performance than IPv6. However, the differences between the two network protocols are slight for most experiments. At the level of Ethernet, the variations in performance among the different Raspberry Pi models are noticeable, where the RPi Zero W has the poorest performance, while the RPi 4 Model B shows the best performance.  © 2022 ACM.},

Oscilloscope can be called as CRO or DSO. It also display any other form of signal by converting it into voltages. These types of oscilloscopes are costly and they are difficult to carry to different places. Cost of maintenance and repair is very high in these kind of oscilloscope. Hence, in this project portable and cost effective Oscilloscope has been developed with the help of Raspberry Pi boards. Raspberry Pi is a tiny and an affordable computer which gives best Graphical User Interface and Graphical Programming can be done with the help of Matplotlib. Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and it is built upon Numpy. MCP3008 (ADC), a 10 bit analog to digital converter, sampling at the rate of 200ksps is also used. This helps in converting the external signals to digital signals. With the help of Raspberry Pi, the captured signals are plotted and can be viewed in the output screen. Wi-Fi module is interfaced with Raspberry Pi and by installing a RDP (remote desktop connection) android application in the mobile phone, output can be viewed on mobile phone using Wi-Fi. With the help of remote desktop connection, portability is achieved. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {ANPR system is used in automating access control and security such as identifying stolen cars in real time by installing it to police patrol cars, and detecting vehicles that are overspeeding on highways. However, this technology is still relatively expensive; in November 2014, the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) purchased and installed 20 units of ANPR systems in their patrol vehicles costing nearly RM 30 million. In this paper a cheaper alternative of a portable ANPR system running on a Raspberry Pi with OpenCV library is presented. Once the camera captures an image, image desaturation, filtering, segmentation and character recognition is all done on the Raspberry Pi before the extracted number plate is displayed on the LCD and saved to a database. The main challenges in a portable application include crucial need of an efficient code and reduced computational complexity while offering improved flexibility. The performance time is also presented, where the whole process is run with a noticeable 3 seconds delay in getting the final output. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	abstract = {ARM-based single board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry Pi capture the imaginations of hobbyists and scientists due to their low cost and versatility. With the deluge of data produced in edge environments, SBCs and SBC clusters have emerged as low-cost platform for data collection and analysis. Simultaneously, security is a growing concern as new regulations require secure communication for data collected from the edge. In this paper, we compare the performance of a Raspberry Pi cluster to a power-efficient next unit of computing (NUC) and a midrange desktop (MRD) on three leading cryptographic algorithms (AES, Twofish, and Serpent) and assess the general-purpose performance of the three systems using the HPL benchmark. Our results suggest that hardware-level instruction sets for all three cryptographic algorithms should be implemented on single board computers to aid with secure data transfer on the edge.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Peaberries are a special type of coffee bean with an oval shape. Peaberries are not considered defective, but separating peaberries is important to make the shapes of the remaining beans uniform for roasting evenly. The separation of peaberries and normal coffee beans increases the value of both peaberries and normal coffee beans in the market. However, it is difficult to sort peaberries from normal beans using existing commercial sorting machines because of their similarities. In previous studies, we have shown the availability of image processing and machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and k-nearest-neighbors (KNNs), for the classification of peaberries and normal beans using a powerful desktop PC. As the next step, assuming the use of our system in the least developed countries, this study was performed to examine their implementation in and the limitations of Raspberry Pi 3. To improve the performance, we modified the CNN architecture from our previous studies. As a result, we found that the CNN model outperformed both linear SVM and KNN on the use of Raspberry Pi 3. For instance, the trained CNN could classify approximately 13.77 coffee bean images per second with 98.19% accuracy of the classification with 64*64 pixel color images on Raspberry Pi 3. There were limitations of Raspberry Pi 3 for linear SVM and KNN on the use of large image sizes because of the system's small RAM size. Generally, the linear SVM and KNN were faster than the CNN with small image sizes, but we could not obtain better results with both the linear SVM and KNN than the CNN in terms of the classification accuracy. Our results suggest that the combination of the CNN and Raspberry Pi 3 holds the promise of inexpensive peaberries and a normal bean sorting system for the least developed countries. © 2022. the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

This paper proposes a method of developing a comprehensive embedded class attendance systemusing facial recognition with controlling the door access. The system is based on Raspberry Pi thatruns Raspbian (Linux) Operating System installed on micro SD card. The Raspberry Pi Camera, as well as a 5-inch screen, are connected to the Raspberry Pi. By facing the camera, the camera will capture the image then pass it to the Raspberry Pi which is programmed to handle the face recognition by implementing the Local Binary Patterns algorithm LBPs. If the student's input image matches withthetrained dataset image the prototype door will open using Servo Motor, then the attendance results will be stored in the MySQL database. The database is connected to Attendance Management Syste(AMS) web server, which makes the attendance results reachable to any online connected web browser.The system has 95 % accuracy with the dataset of 11 person images. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Embedded computers such as Raspberry Pi are gaining market as they offer considerable computation power on a flexible platform that can run different operating systems and user level libraries. There are a number of contributions on building middleware for connecting devices based on embedded computers in various ways; however, the temporal behavior of these systems has not been sufficiently covered, despite the fact that this is essential to validate the system design, operation, and timeliness that is needed in domains such as cyber-physical systems (CPS). This paper analyzes the temporal behavior of the connection among embedded computers and servers in the context of time sensitive deployments where some nodes can be virtualized offering mixed criticality execution platforms. We provide a scheme for using the Data Distribution Service standard to connect embedded computers based on Raspberry Pi and servers to analyze the temporal response stability. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

This approach is not only cost effective but also a feasible alternative to traditional healthcare. The aged peoples and patients having chronic diseases refrain visit to health institutions (hospitals and nursing homes etc.) as a result it reduces burden on health institutions. In this paper we proposed IoT-based, intelligent HMS which continuously monitors patient's health parameters like blood pressure, heart beat and ECG. Data from blood pressure sensor, heart rate sensor and ECG sensor automatically monitored by Arduino UNO and Pi-camera attached to raspberry pi for video. Arduino UNO sends sensor data to raspberry pi which fed data to server's database using Wi-Fi, finally server sent data to webpage, which updates every 2 minutes.

	abstract = {Small-scale fishermen face various occupational safety hazards due to unavailability of real-time weather information during fishing activities at sea. Whilst provision of such information could greatly reduce these risks, limited personal assistants exist that could support small scale fishermen in their activities at sea with real-time details on wind speed and direction, rainfall, humidity, geographical location and distance from shore, among others. Furthermore, large scale solutions are too expensive for this category of fishermen to afford. Even though the recent emergence of the Raspberry Pi showed to significantly decrease costs of computational systems, the application of this technology to build solutions for small-scale fishermen is yet to be investigated. As such, this paper investigates the implementation and deployment of a low-cost Raspberry Pi based personal assistant for small-scale fishermen, through a proposed device named JarPi. © 2017 IEEE.},

With this aim, in this paper, we have proposed a surveillance system for real time landslide monitoring using computer vision algorithms. Here we have used a video camera to acquire live view of landslide site and a small computer board 'raspberry Pi' to run the algorithm we will introduce here. When landslide is detected SMS text messages are transmitted using a GSM modem. Due to video camera and Raspberry Pi, this method is inexpensive yet efficient and also requires low power, therefore this method can be used in any region. We have used median filtering to remove noise present in the detection algorithm. Here we have also proposed a new implementation method for median filtering using a linked list and parallel processing which is very time efficient. © 2019 IEEE.},

An image capturing system with embedded computing as one of its significant parts extracts image information and requires no external processing system. To deliver results to other devices for the corresponding inputs, we use an interface device. The designed system is fast and efficient. It coordinates efficiently with the image recognition unit and the recognition algorithm. The system ensures a smooth flow of data stream between the two devices, namely, the Raspberry PI board and the camera. It also handles the data stream flow to occur smoothly between the camera and the Raspberry PI board.

	abstract = {Melon requires intensive treatment with a high cost of maintenance. Digital image processing with deep learning can help handle diseases in melon plants efficiently. Deep-learning-based object detection has significantly better accuracy than the traditional one. However, the deep-learning-based approach leads to high computational and storage resources consumption. Speed and accuracy become tradeoffs to deal with its implementation on devices with limited computing capabilities like Raspberry Pi. This study comparatively analyzes deep-learning-based object detection algorithm performance implemented on a limited computing device, namely Raspberry Pi. The detected object in this study is melon leaves which are classified into two categories, namely abnormal and normal. The experiment was conducted using Faster R-CNN, Single Shot Multibox Detection (SSD), and YOLOv3. The results showed that Faster R-CNN had the highest mAP (~49 %) that ran ~2.5 seconds for an image but had the highest resource usage. Since accuracy is more important than time complexity in melon leaf detection, Faster R-CNN can be recommended as the best object detection algorithm to implement on Raspberry Pi. However, SSD is a fast algorithm with considerable accuracy for real-time detection. In addition, it had not only fast computational time, but SSD MobileNetV2 also spent the least resource usage. Although YOLOv3 had a significantly better running time (0.5 s) which made YOLOv3 the fastest algorithm, it had too low mAP (below 20%). Therefore, YOLOv3 is not recommended for melon leaf abnormality detection since it can allow more detection errors to occur © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License},

In this manner, this paper shows the use of some artificial neurons to generate chaotic binary sequences whose randomness is enhanced by post-processing approaches and measured by performing statistical NIST SP 800-22 tests. The chaotic neurons are synchronized by different methods and each neuron is implemented on a Raspberry Pi, which allows connectivity to a machine-to-machine (M2M) broker. This wireless connectivity advantage is exploited herein to develop a lightweight cryptographic application under the message queueing telemetry transport (MQTT) for Internet of Things (IoT) protocol. The synchronized neurons have a topology in which one Raspberry Pi works as publisher and can send encrypted information to multiple subscribers. Due to the chaotic behavior of the neurons, the Raspberry Pi acting as subscriber can recover the encrypted information if and only if it has the right key, i.e., the correct random binary sequence generated by the publisher. To augment the security against attacks, the chaotic neurons have different initial conditions before M2M synchronization is accomplished, and the color image encryption under MQTT for IoT is evaluated by performing correlation, histogram, variance, entropy, and NPCR tests. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Similar to a fingerprint search system, face recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects or finding missing persons. Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect's face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer's uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in accurate detection of faces compared to state-of-the-art face detection and recognition methods, and verify its effectiveness for enhancing law-enforcement services in smart cities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is an increasingly popular wireless technology that allows researchers to monitor wild bird populations from fixed locations in the field. I have developed an RFID-equipped birdfeeder based on the Raspberry Pi Zero W, a low-cost single-board computer, that collects continuous visitation data from birds marked with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Each birdfeeder has a perch antenna connected to an RFID-reader board on a Raspberry Pi powered by a portable battery. When a tagged bird lands on the perch to eat from the feeder, its unique code is stored with the date and time on the Raspberry Pi. These birdfeeders require only basic soldering and coding skills to assemble, and can easily be outfitted with additional hardware like video cameras and microphones. I outline the process of assembling the hardware and setting up the operating system for the birdfeeders.

However, it is expensive and huge, bringing pain to current meteorological stations on the market. The aim is to develop a weather station that provides real-Time warnings for climate monitoring, interfaces with a cloud platform and analyses weather. This project has been completed with a Weather Station to record weather conditions by means of SparkFun Weather Shield, Arduino Uno R3 and Weather Meter. Data from the sensors are then recorded using Raspberry Pi 3 Model B in Google Cloud SQL, where they are gateway and the analysis of meteorological data is done. The website and mobile application are designed to illustrate real-Time weather conditions for managing and users using Google Data Studio and Android Studio. In this Article various environmental components may be monitored in real time utilising IoT at minimum costs. For this reason, we use the ARM-based Raspberry Pi board. The Raspberry Pi OS is selected for the Linux kernel. Python, as the Idle is understood, is a programming language. A wide range of digital and analogue sensors, such DHT11, BMP180, LDR and a distinctive scale, are used with ULN2803 for measuring the environment parameter. The Raspberry Pi server, which is saved to CSV and text files, reads these input sensor data. Customers may obtain this information from anywhere in the globe on stuffpeak.com in real time.

It is constructed around a Raspberry Pi single-board computer, which serves as the controller and user interface. The Pi is interfaced with an expansion board that controls the potential applied to a disposable screen-printed electrode and facilitates data acquisition from a photomultiplier tube (PMT), which detects the ECL emission from the sensor surface. As proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that this arrangement can quantitate tris(2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)3]2+]) with an estimated limit of detection (LOD) of 20 pM, and C-reactive protein with an LOD of 50 fg mL−1. The analytical performance of the Raspberry Pi-based setup is comparable to a conventional ECL configuration (computer, potentiostat and photodetector). The Raspberry Pi-based setup can replace a conventional ECL setup, at a fraction of the cost, without sacrificing sensitivity or versatility. The combination of a single-board computer and a sensitive light detector represents a significant step towards translating ECL instruments into mobile, point-of-care diagnostic platforms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this study, a Low-cost and portable module is built using a Raspberry Pi camera and microprocessor that captures the images of security holograms which are fed into the hyperspectral imaging algorithm that measures the reflectance to differentiate the counterfeit from the original hologram. Reflectivity is one of the difficulties in distinguishing a duplicate hologram from an authentic one. Due to the fact that a little change in lighting situation would entirely alter the hologram's reflection pattern, a standardized detector for duplicate holograms has not yet been developed. In this work, hyperspectral imaging (HSI)-based housing module for distinguishing between authentic and counterfeit holograms was presented. The module included a Raspberry Pi 4 CPU, a Raspberry Pi camera, an LCD display, and an LED lighting system with a dimmer. A visible HSI algorithm capable of transforming a Raspberry Pi camera's RGB picture into a hyperspectral image was developed. Mean gray value (MGV) and reflectivity measurements were performed on an area of interest (ROI) extracted from the spectral picture. Results indicated that shorter wavelengths are optimal for distinguishing holograms when using MGV as the classification criterion, but longer wavelengths are optimal when utilizing reflectivity. This design is distinguished by its cheap cost, simplicity, absence of moving components, and lack of need for an extra decoding key.  © 2022 IEEE.},

It is made possible using digital cameras, a device which is used widely now a days for surveillance purposes. In such a case, the following paper defines the border surveillance system. This is done by computer vision. The requirements includes a camera, Raspberry-pi, Arduino-UNO and Buzzer. The digital camera is used to capture the live movements. The attained information/records are sent as an input to the raspberry pi which uses a computer vision (open CV) software to detect the objects and faces as positive and negative. The corresponding coding is done using python. If any mismatched objects or face (negative) is detected, automatically a signal is sent from the pi module. The desired signal is sent to the authority or monitoring room using transmitter. At one end, the Raspberry-pi module is connected with a monitor, transmitter and at the other end, a receiver with Arduino and buzzer. When any signal is received by a receiver, it is passed to the Arduino, which in turn triggers the buzzer connected to the Arduino and gives an alert signal or sound as it was programmed. In addition to this, the live streaming video can be seen in the monitor/display connected to the raspberry-pi.

The different factor of city life like weather, transportation, water, energy, traffic etc. are improved/handled and analyzed for Information Computing and used for predictive analysis. To create a smart city we need various types of new technologies and techniques like embedded system and wireless sensor. These are small and have low overhead or less power consumption these are used to collect and analyze information of the city factors. In this paper we use the small Linux board that is Raspberry Pi which is small in size and has low overheads. This will allows us to attach and program the different hardware/sensor modules which are used for information gathering and predictive analysis in smart city application. In this paper we used Raspberry pi with GPS and other sensors for secure and predictive bus transportation in schools and collages. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This research aims to design and implement a home security system with the capability for human detection. The traditional home security system, i.e. closed circuit television (CCTV) can only capture and record the video without able to give warning feedback if there is any suspicious object. Therefore, an additional object detection and warning method is required if there is an intruder. The proposed design is implemented using Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino, which are connected by USB cable. The PIR sensor is installed on the Arduino and the webcam is mounted on Raspberry Pi 3. The Raspberry Pi 3 is used to process inputs from received sensors and process images for human detection. The PIR sensor detects the movement around the sensor to activate the webcam to capture a picture. Then, the object recognition is performed using histogram of gradient (HoG) and support vector machine (SVM) to detect the suspicious object. If the suspicious object is detected, then alarm is activated to warn the house owner about the existence of intruder. The evaluation results show that it takes in average 2 seconds for proposed system to detect the intruder. It also shows that the system can successfully detects the intruder with accuracy of 89%. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Vehicle plate recognition system helps to capture a vehicle plate number, extract the numbers on the plate and check the details of the car owner. As the number of car owners in a country increases, identifying and charging unlawful vehicles on the road has been a tedious work for law enforcement agents. In this paper, we present an automatic vehicle plate recognition system using Raspberry pi. A Camera was incorporated to help in capturing the plate number images and it is interfaced to a Raspberry pi processor for authentication. Using the Open Computer Vision (Open CV) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the system can extract numbers from the captured plate image and completely automate the license plate recognition. The experimental results from several testing in different locations and conditions show that the system performed better than most of the baseline studies considered. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) is a well-established optical technique that has been used for non-invasive measurement of blood flow in tissues. Instrumentation for DCS includes a correlation device that computes the temporal intensity autocorrelation of a coherent laser source after it has undergone diffuse scattering through a turbid medium. Typically, the signal acquisition and its autocorrelation are performed by a correlation board. These boards have dedicated hardware to acquire and compute intensity autocorrelations of rapidly varying input signal and usually are quite expensive. Here we show that a Raspberry Pi minicomputer can acquire and store a rapidly varying time-signal with high fidelity. We show that this signal collected by a Raspberry Pi device can be processed numerically to yield intensity autocorrelations well suited for DCS applications. DCS measurements made using the Raspberry Pi device were compared to those acquired using a commercial hardware autocorrelation board to investigate the stability, performance, and accuracy of the data acquired in controlled experiments. This paper represents a first step toward lowering the instrumentation cost of a DCS system and may offer the potential to make DCS become more widely used in biomedical applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Then, the information is sent to the PC or laptop to command the robot movement. However, the large size and high weight of PC or laptop affect the performance of robot movement. In this work, Raspberry Pi is used as processor instead of PC or laptop to control the human following robot by receiving the information from HD webcam. HD webcam is used to tracking colors, which are on the human target. The tracking colors, which are red, blue, and green, are depended on the program setting. OpenCV library is used to connect between HD webcam and Raspberry Pi and enhance the performance of the library working and processor of the Raspberry Pi. Afterwards, human following robot is used to track the human target in various movements with a space between human target and human following robot.

	abstract = {Development of real-time recognition systems for character recognition for Indian scripts is a challenging task. This paper presents a novel real time character reading system for Marathi script. The system is developed using Raspberry Pi and OpenCV Python. The reading system is composed of two modules, namely, image acquisition module and character recognition module. The image acquisition module consists of the camera and the character recognition module does the preprocessing, recognizes the characters and converts them into speech. In this paper, Marathi printed characters without any modifiers are acquired using camera and applied to the character recognition module. The recognition rate achieved is 92% using template matching. © 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Dairy cow milk is a beverage that is often consumed by many people. The quality of milk for dairy cows needs to be maintained because milk naturally experiences relatively rapid decay. Protein content can be used as a parameter used to determine the quality of milk. One method used to analyze protein content of milk is by using a spectrophotometer. Technically, a spectrophotometer in a laboratory serves to measure the transmittance or absorbance of a sample expressed in a wavelength function. The wavelength of a sample varies according to the color of the spectrum used. To test protein content, a biuret spectrophotometry method is used which produces purple in the sample, so that the wavelength with the highest absorbance value is found in the range of 525 nm. The absorbance value of the tested samples of dairy cow milk shows the quantity of protein content. The spectrophotometer system is designed using image processing based methods equipped with Raspberry Pi. Tests were carried out by comparing protein content between standard laboratory spectrophotometers and proposed Raspberry Pi based spectrophotometers. The comparison results obtained from Raspberry Pi based spectrophotometer tests have an average error of 2.366%. The classification of the quality of milk for dairy cows produces 3 levels of classification, namely milk for dairy cows with a protein content of 0% - 2.5% indicating low quality, 2.51% - 7.38% indicating medium quality and 7.39% - 9.63% indicating high quality. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An electronic braille (eBraille) Quran is a braille display that is use to aid the visually impaired and blind Muslims in their journey of understanding and appreciating the Quran in a much more convenient way. It is an invention of University of Technology Malaysia (UTM) since 2009 for the blind people to recite Quran through the Braille system. However, current architecture of eBraille Quran comprises of too many modular components, numerous microcontrollers and complexly designed. Another vital issue is that its architecture still uses old technologies where the firmware updating or data correction process cannot be done remotely. This makes it hard to maintain, repair, costly and time consuming. This study proposed an enhancement of current architecture with the latest technology of single board computer named Raspberry Pi 3B+. The architecture is first designed according to the existing features of the eBraille Quran. Then, a prototype circuit is developed and fabricated for testing purposes of the proposed architecture. Once the circuit is fabricated, an experiment is conducted to test on how well the new architecture manages the intended functionalities, controlling input and output of braille cells, the performance of start-up time and battery consumption. The result shows that the proposed architecture using Raspberry Pi manages to carry out all the proposed functionalities of eBraille Quran. The start-up time is also within tolerable level with only 1 second slower than the current architecture. Battery consumption on the other hand shows that using Raspberry Pi reduces the battery consumption by 1.2% per hour. ©BEIESP.},

This paper proposes a Python-based BCI system for controlling a mobile assistive device using the NeuroSky EEG portable headset and the Raspberry Pi microcontroller board. Thus, disabled persons could enjoy the opportunity of controlling a mobile robot by using commands based on voluntary eye-blinking. The original implementation of the proposed BCI system consisted of Python programming for raw EEG signal analysis on the computer (Spyder IDE) for detection and counting of intentional eye-blinks and Python coding for executing the robot movement commands by the Raspberry Pi (Thonny IDE). The WebSockets protocol facilitates wireless communication between the computer (Windows) and Raspberry Pi. The presented BCI system is an experimental prototype for a better understanding of simulation and testing of the BCI technology by people with neuromotor disabilities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

It is extremely close to us, which is why we must take advantage of it because these changes imply the ability to continue progressing in any area. This project shows how a Raspberry Pi minicomputer may be used to control a Brushless motor and propeller. Thus, a system has been developed for controlling punctual angular locations, given a specific menu, and for stabilizing said positions even in the presence of external disturbances, by adjusting the rotational speed of a Brushless motor through changes in the percentage of a signal pulse width PWM. The controller and data collecting was programmed using the Thonny development environment, which is based on the Python programming language. The results of the implementation suggest that using a low-cost minicomputer, as a control device is beneficial. © 2022 IEEE.},

Very recently, implementations of these devices for diagnostics applications are rapidly gaining ground for research and educational purposes. Among the available solutions, Raspberry Pi represents one of the most used SBCs. In the present work, two setups based on Raspberry Pi and its CMOS-based camera (a 3D-printed device and an adaptation of a commercial product named We-Lab) were investigated as diagnostic instruments. Different camera elaboration processes were investigated, showing how direct access to the 10-bit raw data acquired from the sensor before downstream imaging processes could be beneficial for photometric applications. The developed solution was successfully applied to the evaluation of the oxidative stress using two commercial kits (d-ROM Fast; PAT). We suggest the analysis of raw data applied to SBC and MCB platforms in order to improve results. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This paper is about Consultative Committee for Space Data System for Lossless Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Compression (CCSDS-MHC) algorithm that is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ system using Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP). CCSDS-MHC algorithm along with the full prediction mode is opted due to its best compression ratio (CR) performance. The issue of Hyperspectral Image Compression is the loss of data when compress, thus CCSDS algorithm is used in this research. Besides, with current technologies that require low-power but high-performance devices, Raspberry Pi was chosen to be tested in terms of its performances while being compared to other platforms. AVIRIS (airborne) and Hyperion (spaceborne) are used to test the performance of the system. OpenMP is introduced to simplify the computational operation through parallelization to take advantage of the multi-core architecture of the hardware system. In term of execution time, CCSDS-MHC algorithm when parallelize using OpenMP gave the best performances about 69.4% for AVIRIS 1997 dataset, 69.3% for AVIRIS 2006 dataset and 67.7% for Hyperion dataset. The execution time of performance CCSDS-MHC in Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ comparing with other different multicore platform is validate and the mean parallelize is measured. The result of comparison proves that faster performing task gives the best result due to higher speed of CPU-cores performances. From this research, it is proven that Raspberry Pi which is a low-power embedded platform able to compress the hyperspectral images at optimized speed with the implementation of OpenMP through CCSDS algorithm. Therefore, this research will be useful for further studies in lossless of hyperspectral images. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the security constitutes the most important section of our lives. Automation of a home is an exciting field for security applications. This area has developed with new technologies like Internet of things (IoT). In IoT, each device behaves as a small part of an internet node and each node communicate and interact. Currently, security cameras are used in order to construct safety areas, cities, and homes. The camera records the images and, when a problem occurs, the problem is detected by monitoring the old record. In this study, an IoT-based system is combined with computer vision in order to detect the people. A Raspberry PI 3 card with the size of a credit card was used for this purpose. A motion is detected by the PIR sensor mounted on the Raspberry PI. PIR sensor helps to monitor and get alerts when movement is detected. Afterward, human is detected in the captured image and sends images to a Smartphone by using telegram application. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Colour is the first quality attribute of food that consumers examine and it is an important component of food quality that influences market acceptance. Classification of fruits by visual inspection is an arduous, time-consuming process and prone to human error. The machine vision system is a distributed control system that integrates several machine vision modules with a control module and a user interface unit. This research proposes a method for recognising and sorting tomato fruits into a preferred location continuously. Before designing colour sorter the physical properties of fruits were studied. The major and minor diameter of the tomatoes ranges from 45-60mm and 35-50mm, respectively. The mean geometric diameter, sphericity and surface area were 48.64mm,0.94 and 6477.14mm2 respectively. The average length, width, thickness, bulk density and true density were 54.63mm, 48.44mm, 51.42mm, 0.6874g/cm3, 0.9852g/cm3, respectively. The colour sorter was researched, designed and created with Raspberry Pi, USB camera, servo motor and different digital as well as mechanical components. The model used for Raspberry Pi is Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, USB camera with a video resolution of 640 x 480, 4.2-6V servo motor. Image evaluation is completed on each captured picture and Raspberry Pi will do the selection of which fruit can be sorted. Specific programming code in Python is written for this system. The developed colour sorter captures images and diverts fruits into the respective channel at the rate of 1800 fruits/h (i.e.one fruit per 2 seconds). © 2022, National Institute of Science Communication and Policy Research.

The administration consents to arrangement with the privately owned businesses who manufacture the foundation for national highways for a definite time. The private agencies deduct the amount from the vehicles which are passed on that recently developed the highways. Vehicle detection is the crucial step in the toll collection management system. There are various ways of implementing a toll charging system including manual toll charging, RFID systems and barcodes. However, these techniques are error prone while charging the toll system. In this paper we propose a framework using Tesseract OCR and Raspberry Pi. If an input is passed to Raspberry Pi, then the Raspberry Pi detects and charges an amount for the vehicle by using the web server and its database. Finally an alert message is pushed to the vehicle owner’s mobile number after deducting the amount from the user’s account. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

To counter this we have structured a rescue robot that is autonomous, it pursues track way by dint of 3 ultrasonic sensors in the front. For the processing work Raspberry Pi Model B is utilized which incorporates a grouping of single board processors. The smaller card size is handful as we are utilizing 4wd Car Chassis and a motor controller to drive it through. The robot features computer vision and raspberry pi camera module is used to help with the vision. We trained the camera utilizing algorithm to empower it identify movement, consequently after detecting movement the robot utilizes PIR to detect and affirm human presence. When human life is recognized in a destructed place the web application helps us to observe the live streaming of that found human and the closest environment. The coordination of GPS Module gives us a chance to see the area of where rescue activity is occurring. The web application that is designed by us likewise gives us a chance to do as such. After rescuing the detected individual, it goes on its merry way in repeating the flow of work that is assigned to it helping achieve maximum amount of success and lives saved. The reality to stun is, all these are incorporated in a solitary car chassis and the expense behind the work is insignificant.

The Raspberry Pi, a low-cost single-board computer, is in charge of running 1) the C program that closes the control loop over the selected plant and 2) the JavaScript laboratory web server that hosts the laboratory front-end and communicates it with the controller. Finally, the JavaScript development and runtime platform Node.js is used 1) to develop and run the Javascript laboratory web sever within the Raspberry Pi and 2) to support the communications between the laboratory front-end and server. The new strategy, tested over a Proportional/Integral/Differential (PID) controller for a vertical mono-rotor plant, provides low-cost real-time support to the controller and friendly remote access from mobile devices to the practices for the students. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

The Raspberry Pi was connected to the chatbot server via Wi-Fi using a websockets protocol. The chatbot server is linked to Facebook Messenger using the Messenger Application Protocol Interface. Messages received at the chatbot server are analyzed with RasaNLU to classify the user's intention and extract necessary information which are sent over websocket to the connected Raspberry pi. The system was evaluated using control precision and percentage correct classification with both producing a significant level of acceptance.

In this project, DCT transform will be implemented using PI camera and Raspberry Pi SBC development board running on an ARM based processor. The raspberry Pi board has an advantage of image processing implementation due to the existing software development tool offered a rich feature for image processing such as OPENCV. The result of applying DCT compression algorithm on images with six compression rate level which are 10, 20, 50, 100, 170 and 200. The best performance can be achieved with compression rate level 200.

In IoT network gateways would have an important role for connecting heterogeneous networks to internet. The IoT Gateways must be smart enough to perform collected operations depending on the respective application. The significant actions of IoT Gateway were integration of wireless sensor network and mobile network, protocol mapping, managing the endpoint network, providing secure and safe communication between various end point networks. We proposed a Gateway Pi, a framework of IoT smart and secure gateway integrating with Raspberry Pi board. This proposal did make the IoT gateway as a smart thing and function like a normal PC. Apart from native gateway functionalities, this paper emphasized the security for IoT gateway. In this paper we proposed three measures to provide security for IoT gateways, which makes the gateway as a firewall. And we implemented a cost effective and reliable IoT architecture for smart irrigation using our Gateway Pi. Copyright © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nowadays home automation is used increasingly with the help of Smartly controlling home devices. With the plenty of manufacturers and the latest technologies, the usage of home automation is up to the mark. Firstly, from a social point of view, human care is very essential for physically challenged and elderly people. Secondly, it is implemented using a single Raspberry Pi controller. The controller controls and monitors many home appliances that are interconnected to form a home network. For example, the home appliances such as lights, Fans, temperature and humidity sensors, gas leakage detectors, smoke detectors, and fire detectors can be controlled by a single controller. It also includes the establishment of security and emergency alert systems in case of an emergency. So, this leads to an idea to develop a smart home controlling system for physically challenged people. The system developed must be low cost, low power consumption, cheaper, cost-effective, flexible and it should be user-friendly interface, same as the usage of the remote control of various electronic gadgets in our day-to-day life. It should be designed as user-friendly, so that the person can use it very easily and effectively same as, other hand-held devices. In this paper, a smartly controlling system was developed especially for physically challenged and elderly people. This was done by integrating Raspberry Pi and various sensors into the web applications. To design this system, a Raspberry Pi module along with a voice control technique is used. The output of this system is to control home appliances. All the home appliances are simply controlled by connecting through a monitor built on the internet. Raspberry Pi is used to operate and controls the motion sensors and voice recognition for controlling the home appliance through human voice to provide the smart home. It is a very simple technique that was very much helpful to helpless people.  © 2022 Author(s).},

The position even though is of much importance, it hinders the use of man power for a much higher productive and useful purpose in the office. This paper deals with design and implementation of an automated office receptionist system using Raspberry Pi and an Android application. It not only helps the official to directly interact with the visitor but also to maintain a visitor’s record in the e-mail. This eliminates manual assistance and also improves the security. The device can also be used at home, corporate offices, hospitals, etc., for security purpose and administrative purposes. This simple and cost-effective prototype device is designed and when tested it effectively performed the task of office receptionist. © IAEME Publication},

	abstract = {Developments in the field of Information Technology also make Information Security a devoted part of it. In order to deal with security, Authentication plays an imperative role. In this paper, Biometrics is used for authentication. This paper also describes how biometrics can leverage cloud's boundless computational resources and striking properties of exibility, scalability, and cost reduction in order to reduce the cost of the biometrics system requirements of different computational resources (i.e. processing power or data storage) and to enhance the performance of biometrics systems' processes (i.e. biometric matching). Here, Raspberry Pi is used to build a low-cost biometric system. Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a credit-sized mini-computer with great capabilities similar to a PC. In this study it is used as a remote enrollment node. The application of Raspberry Pi and cloud computing has given a new direction of research into the field of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Using the biometric technology, a new system of IoT based biometrics is proposed. To maintain the security of biometric traits over the Internet channel from RPi client to the cloud, cryptographic algorithms are applied like RSA and enhanced AES-256. The encrypted biometric information is stored on the cloud and the authentication can be done by Biometric service hosted on Azure cloud. Thus, this papers covers the following topics: attracting power of biometrics into the authentication services, biometrics leveraging the power of cloud, Raspberry Pi- a low-cost IoT device, enhanced AES-256 with Round structure and dynamic S-box generation and the new emerging trend of Internet-of-Things. © 2016 The Authors.},

A key cost and resource question in the development of IoT network sensor solutions is prototype implementation. In this study, the Raspberry Pi-a widely used single board computer-is investigated as it is one of the most commonly used prototyping devices available and is also widely used in scientific research. In this paper, we address which technologies, the usefulness and what kinds of issues arise when the prototyping of a sensor network solution is done with Raspberry Pi. The extant literature is studied by selecting papers with the systematic literature review method. Based on an extensive survey of the selected studies, we found several sensor-based implementations where Raspberry Pi has been used. In addition, this survey revealed subjects, such as e-health and education, which expanded the research topic in new ways. Further research opportunities have been identified in specifying the usefulness of various technologies with single board computers. © 2017 Croatian Society MIPRO.},

	abstract = {Performance analysis for devices in Internet of Things (IoT) environments is an important consideration, especially with their increasing integration in technological solutions, worldwide. The Single Board Computers (SBCs) of the Raspberry Pi Foundation have been widely accepted by the community, and hence, they have been incorporated in numerous IoT projects. To ease their integration, it is essential to assess their network performance. In this paper, we made an empirical performance evaluation of one of the most popular network protocols for IoT environments, named the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, on Raspberry Pi. To do so, we set up two different testbeds scenarios and assessed the performance with benchmarks. At the software level, we focused on Mosquitto, a popular open-source MQTT broker implementation and client library. Our principal metric is the transmission time, but we also investigated the throughput. In our experiments, we varied several parameters, such as the size of the payload of the published messages, the WiFi bandwidth, the QoS level, the security level (MQTT vs. MQTT with TLS), and the hardware for the clients and broker. We focus mainly on packet sizes ranging from 100 to 25,000 bytes. We also investigate how these low-cost devices handle a TCP SYN flood attack. In the research work presented within this paper, we aim to guide developers, researchers, network administrators, and hobbyists who plan to use these low-cost devices in an MQTT or IoT network by showing the performance that they should expect according to different Raspberry Pi options © 2022.

To demonstrate the methodology, we compare performance of real-world workloads on this physical infrastructure against corresponding models of the workloads and infrastructure on the CloudSim simulator.

The Raspberry Pi built as a cluster can increase the performance of processing and resources that are compulsory to manage varieties of big data. This study was completed by implementing the Naïve Bayes method on Raspberry Pi cluster server in which collected data using web scraping method will be distributed to each slave node cluster, and then the master node will send signal to process the data.

	abstract = {A conventional phonetic expression into the museums, exhibits, and spectacular places, is hard to ensure the quality demands of the visitors, on account of the languages difference and the large numbers of visitors. Hence, it is essential to develop a Multilanguage sound system, which can answer the different demands of various language users for the same exhibition. The system included RFID technology and a raspberry pi device. The system can define the language of the expression according to the demands of visitors, and then it could provide visitors extensive information about the exhibition in a clear, noise-free sound, as Clear and understandable. This will reduce the workforce and increase performance, but it also can completely ensure the quality of the expression. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of big supermarkets and shopping centers around the world has added to the rapid development of robot technology. In this study a shopper-follower robot was developed to lessen the effort of shoppers especially in grocery areas or supermarkets. The Raspberry Pi-Based Shopping Cart Following Robot uses Raspberry Pi microcomputer which serves as the brain of the system where every module is connected and Python is the programming language that is used for the system. It has a barcode scanner that allows the shopper to scan products and provide an initial bill. The ultrasonic sensor determines the distance between the front side of the shopping cart whether if it is in the waiting state or follow state; it uses Arduino as a connection from its output to the inputs of the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ to eliminate delays of direct connection to Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Another ultrasonic sensor can be found on both sides of the shopping cart to determine obstacles that will be avoided by the shopping cart. The load cell sensor is also used to determine the weight of the products/ items in the shopping cart; it uses the Arduino IDE to develop algorithms that can be used to calibrate weight measurements. The buzzer will serve as the alarm if the weight of the shopping cart reaches above the given maximum weight. The buzzer will also alarm once the shopping cart loses contact with the shopper; the shopping cart has a maximum allowable distance of one (1) meter to the shopper. Also, the robot was equipped with webcam so that it can follow a shopper through computer vision-based algorithm and object tracking. By having several trials, the object tracking method that is used is the Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking (CSRT), for it is much capable of determining the shopping cart's owner throughout the duration time of shopping. As a result, the Raspberry Pi-Based Shopping Cart Following Robot functions well and had performed its intended operation.  © 2022 IEEE.},

In the conventional methodology, substation automation is done by using PLCs and SCADA systems, but for a small substation automation, this system is considerably expensive. This project adopts low cost automation solutions based on recent IOT technology using embedded processors like raspberry pi for automation of a small 11 kV substation. This gives the advantage of cost reduction plus a plethora of connectivity options. In this paper, Codesys IEC 61131-3 software is used to convert a Raspberry pi as a soft PLC. Analog and digital parameters from field are monitored and controlled using GPIOs pins, interfacing relays and communication ports available in raspberry pi. The automation sequences for control monitoring and protection of the system is defined using ladder diagram programming in IEC 61131-3 Codesys development platform. User interface and HMI screens are developed using Codesys web visualization segment which can be accessed both locally as well as over a wired or wireless network. © 2017 IEEE.},

The available tools allow to mix topics related to programming, communications, operating systems, and control theory. The well-known Raspberry Pi board is used as platform to exploit the different proposed concepts. SciPy, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries, which are Python-based open-source libraries for scientiffc computing and graphical representation, are used to perform Matlab-like simulations and to implement classical control loops. On the other hand, virtual processes developed in Easy Java Simulations are adapted to be controlled through the network from a controller implemented on the Raspberry Pi with Python. This option is very useful from a teaching point of view since time-based, networked-based, or event-based control approaches can be easily introduced on this proposed architecture. Furthermore, once students know how to implement control loops on the Raspberry Pi using Python, external real processes can be easily controlled by using the GPIO interface available in the this electronic board. Then, a project based on these tools and ideas is motivated and presented in this paper to control a two-tank level process. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The security system in the room requires remote monitoring, one of the implementations is using the web that can be accessed via a smartphone or laptop. In order to realize a web server, the raspberry pi is needed as the low power consume device. In this study, monitoring system a local network based on the IoT technology (Internet of Things) where an object has the ability to send data over the network without requiring human-to-human or human interaction to the computer. Raspberry pi is used as a web server and is installed by Motion eye as a web interface that is integrated with a webcam that functions as a sensor. Furthermore, the client monitor in the room through the web browser by streaming with define the URL according to the IP address obtained by the raspberry pi from the server. The observations of the systems have been addressed on the number users, number of frames per second and the resolution of the object related to the delay, the throughput, the delay and the CPU performance. The simulations have been defined when the number of user 30 and 70, the resolution of the object was 320 x 176, 320 x 240, 640 x 480 and 1024 x 786, the number of frames per second were 10 fps, 20 fps and 30 fps. The results show that IoT technology have possibility to be implemented for CCTV monitoring using Raspberry Pi. The examining on the CPU usage shows that higher both the resolution and fps on the video results affect the CPU usage performances. However, the video quality becomes better. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {When an accident occurs, the time it takes for an emergency medical facility to be established and operational has a significant impact on a victim's survival. Reduce the time it takes for an accident scene to be examined by a medical professional to reduce the death rate. Emergency responders can be alerted to a disaster by using a Raspberry Pi-based accident identification system. This helps to shorten response times. Vibration sensors detect errors and then send a prepared message to the right people. It's important to know what happened and who was involved in an accident in order to send the appropriate information to emergency responders. It is possible to get accurate longitude and latitude positions for satellites if the first GPS is used in this manner. To get the GSM device to start following the car, you must send it a message. The Raspberry Pi controller's vibration sensor can also be used to identify the error. A pre-programmed emergency server receives every GSM emergency call, no matter where the caller is located. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The developers of path planning algorithms and localization have significantly improved the usability of the robot those days. By using software such as a Gmapping, the robot will be able to create a map of the surrounding area. This research utilizes the 3D sensor Asus-xtion- pro to create an indoor map using SLAM and create 3D models for surrounding objects with a Turtlebot robot. In the first case, we used the Turtlebot to generate an indoor map of the robotic lab room using the Gmapping ROS packet. In the second case, we used the robot to create 3D models for the surrounding objects in the room. We used the Raspberry Pi 3 as a replacement of the laptop that was used to control the Turtlebot. The same implementation of the first and second tasks have been repeated to compare the performance. The Raspberry Pi accomplishes the given tasks successfully; however, there is some delay due to the different on the CPU power. Finally, the low cost proposed solution is capable of running ROS based SLAM algorithm and using the point on cloud to create 3D models. In addition, the use of Raspberry Pi allows the robot save considerable amount of power in contrast with the use of a normal laptop. © 2017 Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK.},

	abstract = {One of the primary goals of computer science education is preparing students to apply what they learn in the classroom to any problem they may encounter in the future. Due to the rapidly changing landscape of technology, regardless of the comprehensiveness of their coursework, at some point students will be required to apply their knowledge to a context they have not encountered before, and understand how what they have learned applies. One of the content areas where this is particularly relevant is helping students recognize the variety of technologies and applications in which object oriented design patterns can produce significant practical benefits. To foster this aptitude, we sought to leverage the students' own creativity with a Raspberry Pi and a multitude of sensors, displays, cameras, and actuators to boost exploration of technologies and student understanding of how course concepts apply outside of constructed examples. This paper presents the experience of using student creativity with the Raspberry Pi to drive their learning in an upper level software design patterns course. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {File sharing is a corner stone application of network computing. The most popular way to achieve an efficient file sharing through the Internet is to use Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocols via applications such as BitTorrent. However, BitTorrent is an open file sharing service that allows files to be shared widely without the consent, or control, of the original publisher of the work. Such a fact is undesirable for a lot of organizations and institutions since it raises copyright and content ownership issues. In this paper we propose an efficient BitTorrent-like protocol that aims at privatizing the P2P network such that control over the distribution of copyrighted material can be achieved. This is done by limiting the user set to those authorized based on their machines MAC addresses and by using dedicated equipment, i.e. the Raspberry PI board. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With almost 3.75 million people with visually impaired in Indonesia, according to statistical data shown that most of them not live in prosperity. To increase their productivity they need an assistive device that's allows them to navigate freely. This paper presents a novel Audio guidance system for blind in the shape of simple bag with earphone for giving them an audio guidance efficiently and safety. Different with other audio guidance, we propose a simple system consist of Raspberry Pi Camera and Ultrasonic Sensor as input, Raspberry Pi, Earphone and Power bank. This system is initiated by providing a voice command of the direction where the blind person must walk or go through, so they can avoid from obstacles. We also apply Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to detect the obstacles along they walk by using 3 ultrasonic sensors. The experimental result shows that by using FLC and interfacing by Raspberry Pi the proposed system can effectively to detect the obstacles and give direction with 2.32% distance error. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In modeling and simulation lab for the second year undergraduate students, the open ended experiment is designed to expose the students to Internet of things (IOT) applications. Python language is one of the freeware and can be used to implement IOT applications using Raspberry Pi. In most of the industries python programming language is widely used for various test automation. Initially the python language is introduced to implement numerical computation algorithms, so that the students are familiar with the basic libraries. Then the open ended experiment is carried out using Raspberry Pi for IOT applications. In this experiment the students are sensing and retrieving data from the cloud. With this approach the students are exposed to python programming and IOT concepts which is most widely used in industry. It also helps the students to carry out higher semester projects in IOT based applications in a better way. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper mainly deals with image denoising algorithm by applying bilateral filter in Laplacian subbands using raspberry pi. Bilateral filter is used for reducing various noises especially Additive White Gaussian Noise which occur more in standard test images. The important feature of this nonlinear bilateral filter is the preservation of the edges, while reducing the noise in the images. The main idea is to replace the pixel’s intensity value by a weighted average of adjacent pixel intensity value. Euclidean distance and radiometric differences of pixels, are used for weight calculation. This calculation mainly preserves sharp edges by looping through each pixel and adjusting weights to the nearest pixel values. Our project aims to reduce cost and power consumption using Raspberry pi. It consists of series of microcomputer packed onto a single circuit board. These low power computers are mass produced at very low prices. The performance of Raspberry pi is equivalent to a personal computer. In order to perform noise reduction in Raspberry pi, python2 and opencv package is installed in real-time Raspbian Linux operating system and algorithm is executed using python2 programming language. The denoising method using Laplacian subbands provides better denoised images compared to Gaussian filter and Bilateral filter that applied in standard test images. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

To provide situational awareness to grid operators, a smart grid system must be able to detect alarm events (such as sudden voltage fluctuations or drops in current) in close to real-time.

We build a prototype cluster and test our approach on a real data set of approximately 1 million measurements derived from 8 PMUS from a 1000:1 scale emulation of a working power grid. Our results show that a cluster of 12 Raspberry Pis is capable of achieving better performance than a more power-hungry multicore server at lower cost and a significant reduction in power consumption. © 2017 IEEE.},

In this prospective system, a process is developed through which power will be supplied after ensuring the existence of human and gas leakage will be apprised immediately. Here, Raspberry Pi 3 and the WeMOS D1 mini is the master apparatus of this system supported by many other microcontrollers like PIR sensor, gas sensor etc. when human is not encountered by the PIR sensor for a fixed time, controlling the relay module through connection Raspberry Pi will ensure power disconnection (like: light and fans will go turn off which left turned on by the user abstractly). On the other hand, while the PIR sensor is detecting human/animal presence in a room, power(like: light, fan etc.) will be turned on through the relay module and also apprise the user about the human existence. Besides, when gas leakage is detected by Gas sensor it makes the WeMOS known about this, which transfers signal to raspberry Pi and it apprises the user immediately through GMS module. Thus, the user can restrain the unauthorized access to his home and also can rescue his home from unwanted accidents. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Facial expression analysis for human-computer interaction, the driver’s state monitoring, or user emotion state monitoring has always been a very important issue in emotion recognition. People have a few emotions, and in different emotions, their facial expressions will have different characteristics. For example, if a person is happy, he/she may be with smiling face or smiling eyes, and if a person is angry or sad, he/she may frown. Once the system identified the user’s facial expression, there will be a corresponding action. This paper presents a framework for the use of raspberry functions to develop emotion recognition systems. We use Raspberry Pi’s camera module to detect the user’s facial expressions and use the Microsoft emotion recognition API to identify the user’s emotion. If the recognition result is angry or sad emotion, the system will broadcast gentle music and tune the light to be soft to smooth the person’s mood. Experiments results indicated the system can interact with users’ emotions. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the current age of digitalization, the increasing rate of cybercrimes has become a great matter to the public and private sectors. To mitigate these issues, governments and companies began a journey of building technological solutions and training individuals in the digital forensic field. This has sprouted a growth of digital forensic tools, sold by vendors to detect and analyze cybercrimes, and report the findings to the forensic investigator. However, most of these tools are quite expensive to a point where medium and small size businesses would struggle to afford them. To overcome this issue, we propose, in this paper, an easy to use and inexpensive solution based on a miniature pocket size computer, namely Raspberry Pi, running an image of Kali Linux on the mini SD card. This Raspberry Pi is configured to conduct acquisition of various storage media via physical and remote (network) access. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Automated detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) could be a potential solution for the detection of DR at the early stages, thereby minimizing the requirement of expensive and complicated surgeries. Recent advancement in the field of artificial intelligence and computing devices has fueled the research in these areas. Large databases (KAGGLE) available resulted in the application of convolution neural networks (CNN) and its variants (ImageNet) for accurate DR detection. In this paper implementation of deep learning architecture in Raspberry Pi is proposed to classify DR. Proposed system classifies DR into five different categories - No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe and Proliferative depending on the severity of the problem. 35126 images are used for training (90%) and validation (10%) of the model. The model gave high accuracy during the testing phase and system implementation. The proposed scheme using the Raspberry PI system to test the images acquired, thereby reducing the overall cost and this facilitates the detection of diabetic retinopathy by the deployment of the system in primary health centers. © 2020 IEEE.},

The system is designed using Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera Module which make the system cost effective and stand alone. An Open Source Computer Vision is integrated on Raspberry Pi for real time image processing. A general purpose higher-level language, Python is used for programming the Raspberry Pi. The main idea of the system is recognizing iris from an image of eye and finding out centroid of an iris. In the proposed system command is given to robot depending on centroid position. The command can be FORWARD, LEFT or RIGHT when the iris is at the center, left and right respectively. Command STOP is generated when there is failure of iris detection. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Wireless electronic notice boards are a faster alternative to conventional pin-up type notice boards. A major constraint of the methods used so far is the small size of the 16°2 Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) used to display the notices. This paper proposes a method in which large screens like computer monitors or televisions can be used for displaying notices sent as text messages from a mobile phone. The proposed method uses HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to present the output since it offers many customisation options. To give high resolution output, the credit-card sized computer Raspberry pi has been used. This HTML output can be displayed by a web browser running on the Raspberry pi. The notice to be displayed is sent as a Short Message Service (SMS), which is received by a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) modem, making the reception of the message wireless. The GSM modem is polled at regular intervals by the Raspberry pi to display the latest messages. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Teaching bioinformatics at universities is complicated by typical computer classroom settings. As well as running software locally and online, students should gain experience of systems administration. For a future career in biology or bioinformatics, the installation of software is a useful skill. We propose that this may be taught by running the course on GNU/Linux running on inexpensive Raspberry Pi computer hardware, for which students may be granted full administrator access.Results: We release 4273π, an operating system image for Raspberry Pi based on Raspbian Linux. This includes minor customisations for classroom use and includes our Open Access bioinformatics course, 4273π Bioinformatics for Biologists. This is based on the final-year undergraduate module BL4273, run on Raspberry Pi computers at the University of St Andrews, Semester 1, academic year 2012-2013.Conclusions: 4273π is a means to teach bioinformatics, including systems administration tasks, to undergraduates at low cost. © 2013 Barker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a design is proposed of a Pupillometer, which comprises of a spectacle mounted Pi-NoIR Infrared Camera system to detect pupil dilation, constriction and saccades of the eyes of the patient. These parameters are tracked using IR Illuminators mounted on spectacle frame that will be interfaced to a Raspberry Pi 2 Development board. The Raspberry Pi 2 is programmed to map the visual acuity parameters. To achieve constriction and dilation, bright LEDs of White, Red, Green and Blue wavelengths are Turned ON and OFF respectively, at rapid rate, while the tracking is going on. The saccade velocity assessment is done by showing a rapidly moving pattern between 2 points. Thus, by obtaining these ranges for the patient and comparing them with a pre-calibrated diabetes proneness scale, the patient's proneness to diabetes and also an accurate measure of his/her Visual Acuity is obtained. A standard deviation of plus or minus five percent with respect to the database values of normal and diabetic patients is mapped and the proneness to Type 2 Diabetes is evaluated. This paper proposes a preventive diagnostics, cost effective and a prick free standalone modality for early diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes. The Visual Acuity is proportional to the patient's proneness to Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy which is a prime symptom of Type 2 Diabetes. © 2016 IEEE.},

This helps to shorten response times. The vibration sensor detects the error and then sends the prepared message to the right person. It is important to know what happened and who was involved in an accident in order to send appropriate information to emergency responders. It is possible to get precise latitude and longitude positions for satellites if GPS is first used in this way.

This article presents a solution for the communication of high definition video in low-delay scenarios (<200 ms) under the constraints of devices with limited hardware resources, such as the Raspberry Pi. We verify that it is possible to enable low delay video streaming between Raspberry Pi devices using a distributed Internet of Things system called the SensibleThings platform. Specifically, our implementation transfers a 6 Mbps H.264 video stream of 1280 × 720 pixels at 25 frames per second between devices with a total delay of 181 ms on the public Internet, of which the overhead of the distributed Internet of Things communication platform only accounts for 18 ms of this delay. We have found that the most significant bottleneck of video transfer on limited Internet of Things devices is the video coding and not the distributed communication platform, since the video coding accounts for 90% of the total delay. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Siege software has been used to generate artificial traffic and to measure parameters such as throughput, transactions, transaction rate, concurrency, response time and data transferred. Results were analyzed by modeling the linear and nonlinear models for each and every parameter against the number of users.

	abstract = {Malaysia has been ranked as one of the countries in the world with the deadliest roads. Based on the reported statistics for 2016, a total of 7152 people died due to road accidents in Malaysia, and these accidents are often caused by human errors. Efforts to curb these accidents include increasing patrols by authorities and joint campaigns involving transport authorities and police but these efforts are not long-term as they only focus around accident hotspots nationwide. The Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) aims to assist drivers and to increase car safety, not only through improving driving experience but also through taking into consideration the overall passenger safety. In recent years, driver’s drowsiness has been one of the major causes of road accidents, resulting in severe physical injuries and deaths, resulting in significant economic loss. In this paper, a vision-based real-time driver alert system, aimed mainly to monitor the driver’s drowsiness condition and distraction condition, is proposed. The real-time driver alert system consists of (1) a drowsiness warning system in the Driver Drowsiness Monitoring System (DDMS) module, and, (2) a Raspberry Pi development board, a camera, two LEDs, and a buzzer in the Raspberry Pi Deployment (RPD) module. The DDMS module focus on monitoring the driver’s condition in a quad-step method: (1) detecting driver’s face, (2) detecting eyes region, a (3) estimating the rate of eyes closure, i.e. drowsiness level, and (4) estimating the head pose, i.e. inattentiveness in driver, in order to monitor the driver’s condition. The RPD module focus on (1) embedding the DDMS system into the Raspberry Pi, mounted with a Raspberry Pi camera with a buzzer, to capture the driver’s condition, and (2) mounting the system in the car, to alert the driver by providing a medium loud beeping sound. Experimental results show that proposed system is practical and low-cost which could (1) embed the real-time drowsiness detection module, and (2) provide alert notification to the driver when the driver is inattentive, using a medium loud beeping sound, in real-time. © 2019, ECTI Association.

It needs introduction of new technology and a better approach to improve the traffic condition. A possible solution to this problem is the density based automatic traffic control system. The proposed model checks for the density of traffic at the traffic signal and changes the traffic lights accordingly. A video camera and traffic lights are interfaced with Raspberry Pi board. The video is processed real time and the Raspberry Pi enables the traffic lights to change when required. This could make the movement of traffic easier and time saving.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) products became recently an essential part of any home in conjunction with the great advancements in internet speeds and services. The invention of IoT based devices became an easy task that could be performed through the widely available IoT development boards. Raspberry Pi is considered one of the advanced development boards that have high hardware capabilities with a reasonable price. Unfortunately, the security aspect of such products is overlooked by the developers, revealing a huge amount of threats that result in invading the privacy and the security of the users. In this research, we directed our study to SSH due to its extensive adoption by the developers. It was found that due to the nature of the Raspberry Pi and development boards, the Raspberry Pi generates predictable and weak keys which make it easy to be utilized by MiTM attack. In this paper, Man in The Middle (MiTM) attack was conducted to examine the security of different variations provided by the SSH service, and various hardening approaches were proposed to resolve the issue of SSH weak implementation and weak keys. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.},

The cost of assessment of Wi-Fi signal quality is still expensive and its continuity of the monitoring is not guaranteed. The number of monitoring devices such as spec- trum analyzer is limited, and they will not stay at one place to monitor the entire Wi-Fi coverage under geographically distributed deployment. Monitoring feature of Wi-Fi signal at production-level access points does not reect the actual situation of clients. Wi-Pi is a low-cost and stationary solu- tion that distributes multiple Raspberry Pis in an enterprise network for monitoring Wi-Fi signal quality and network performance such as packet loss and latency. Taking the ad- vantage of reasonable cost of Raspberry Pi, Wi-Pi collects client-side Wi-Fi performance information and visualizes it as a geographical heat map. Prototype implementation of Wi-Pi has been deployed to cover a small part of the cam- pus network in Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. The aim of this paper is to make Wi-Fi monitoring to be low-cost, open source and deployable. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

	abstract = {                             The development of a touchscreen platform for rodent testing has allowed new methods for cognitive testing that have been back-translated from clinical assessment tools to preclinical animal models. This platform for cognitive assessment in animals is comparable to human neuropsychological tests such as those employed by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, and thus has several advantages compared to the standard maze apparatuses typically employed in rodent behavioral testing, such as the Morris water maze. These include improved translation of preclinical models, as well as high throughput and the automation of animal testing. However, these systems are relatively expensive, which can impede progress for researchers with limited resources. Here we describe a low-cost touchscreen operant chamber based on the single-board computer, Raspberry Pi                             TM                             , which is capable of performing tasks similar to those supported by current state-of-the-art systems. This system provides an affordable alternative for cognitive testing in a touchscreen operant paradigm for researchers with limited funding.                          © 2018, Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, pollution is remaining as a major issue of concern. Air pollution is basically a mixture of various dangerous particles and toxic gases in the environment. The release of suspended particles, hazardous gases, dust pollutants cause depletion of ozone layer. In this paper, various sensors are used to identify carbon dioxide gas present in the air, humidity, environment temperature, and atmospheric pressure. Raspberry pi 3 and Arduino UNO are boards used in interfacing above mentioned sensors. MQ-135 is air pollution gas sensor interfaced with Arduino uno and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor is interfaced with Raspberry pi 3 along with HW-611 e/p 280 atmospheric pressure detection sensor. As soon as atmospheric pressure sensor detects air pressure with humidity and temperature the result obtained will automatically get fed in ThingSpeak IOT app. After wards, derived value on IOT can be read. To run Arduino uno board Arduino IDE software have been used. Arduino IDE software is an open source software that makes easy code writing, compiling and then it uploads the code on the basis of circuitry designed in UNO board. Raspberry pi installation requires a long running process and to run the circuitry a software named Putty is required. Coding is done in Python as Putty work with python. Installation of Raspbian OS in the fresh flashed SD card is the basic step to give power to raspberry pi. The models have been implemented on ThingSpeak using cloud computing. Sensors used in the presented work have been interfaced to their respective board in order to perform detection of various parameters in real time and obtain detection results simultaneously © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This project employs the IoT with an intelligent event-driven system in order to realize an efficient quasi real-time attendance tracker. The idea is to keep the whole system in the standby mode except for the low power motion sensor. On the detection of an event, when a person enters and originates a motion, the front-end embedded processor is alarmed. Afterwards, it activates the remaining system modules like webcam, communication block, etc. The event-driven feature improves the system performance in terms of resources utilization and power consumption compared to the counter classical ones. A first system implementation is realized and successfully tested. It is based on a raspberry pi 3 board, which is integrated with two Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors and two webcams. On the occurrence of an event the webcam is activated and it captures an image. The image is recorded via the Raspberry Pi webcam server and is shared with other system modules via the Porta Space application, which acts as a hub between the Raspberry Pi and the cloud. Simultaneously the attendance status is updated via the IFTTT on the cloud-based log. Moreover, the concerned authorities are notified via an email. The process is repeated every time when a person enters or leaves the concerned place. The attendance log remains globally available via the cloud and can be accessed anytime. The system design flow is described. The devised system functionality is tested with an experimental setup. Results have confirmed a proper system operation. © 2018 IEEE.},

We have studied the elastic WLAN system that dynamically optimizes the network configuration depending on traffic demands. Our testbed experiments using Raspberry Pi revealed that concurrent TCP communications of multiple hosts with a single AP cause the unfairness in throughput performances. In this paper, we propose the TCP fairness control method for two-host concurrent communications. The delay is introduced in the AP at the packet transmissions to the faster host, to increase transmission opportunities with the slower host. The delay is initially estimated by the received signal strength (RSS) from each host, and then, is dynamically optimized using the PI controller. For evaluations, we implement the proposal in the elastic WLAN system testbed, and conduct extensive experiments, where the TCP throughput fairness is achieved. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Online monitoring of oceans like pollution monitoring, algae blooms, tsunami warnings, etc., are really challenging because of the latency involved in sending, storing, and processing of data in the cloud. To mitigate this issue, machine learning models have to be run at the edge close to where the data is generated but requires a huge dataset at monitoring equipment and must withstand the intermittent network connectivity thus be able to take the own decisions. This paper describes the implementation of Greengrass IoT, an Edge computing software developed by Amazon Web Services at maritime environments by running the local machine learning inferences without the need for datasets at the monitoring equipment. In this paper, the amazon sagemaker neo deep learning runtime is deployed at the Greengrass core (Raspberry-pi) for marine plastic pollution monitoring which predicts the images taken from the raspberry-pi camera based on Resnet-50 neural network model before sending data to the cloud. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Almost from the beginning, computer science was hampered by the perception that computer science exclusively focused on programming. This results in computational-related learning being very limited and minimally taught to students. The widespread use of ICT tools in indirect learning has changed the way students interact with content. This paper presents a different approach, while keeping the teacher at the centre of control of classroom activities but students are given the opportunity to explore the content to be learned by CS-Unplugged and Raspberry Pi. This activity aims to provide basic knowledge about how computers work. One of the activities is a simulation and experimentation on how computers work through the CS Unplugged approach. The basic knowledge formed from the simulation was then used as the basis for assembling a simple computer using Raspberry Pi. Based on the results of observations and interviews conducted, the utilization of CS Unplugged provides a learning experience that builds on the initial concept of how computers work. This is shown by an increase in students' motivation and enthusiasm in learning how the computer works. This experience is what then makes it easy for students to do various computer assembly experiments using Raspberry Pi. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The goal was to reignite public interest in programming and increase enrollment in college computer science. Today, the third RPi iteration features a multicore processor, a small GPU for display graphics, WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity. Surprisingly, even though the RPi has become very popular with the public and college students for do-it-yourself projects and maker culture, instructors have not widely used it to teach operating systems concepts. In this paper, I share my experience using the RPi in my Operating Systems class. The paper makes the following contributions: • Pedagogical advantages of using the RPi over other traditional and cloud-based methods to teach operating systems concepts • Challenges for the instructor and students running many RPis in a classroom setting over the campus enterprise network. • Advantages of using the RPi to stimulate student creativity and motivate them to design and implement their own related computing projects. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The conventional approach to monitoring insect swarming is based on traps that are periodically checked by human operators. However, human checking of trap contents is expensive, and in many environments, the pest species most frequently encountered in the traps can be detected and monitored automatically. To achieve this goal, a dedicated data acquisition device is necessary, which makes real-time and online pest monitoring possible from a distant location. In addition, it is beneficial for the device to run machine learning algorithms that count and identify insects automatically from pictures. Thanks to the advantages of integrated circuits, more systems have been designed to improve integrated pest management in the context of precision agriculture. However, in our opinion, all of those systems have one or more disadvantages, such as high cost, low power autonomy, low picture quality, a WIFI coverage requirement, intensive human control, and poor software support. Therefore, the aim of this work is to present a novel plug-in board for automatic pest detection and counting. The plug-in board is dedicated to Raspberry Pi devices, especially the Raspberry Pi Zero. The proposed board, in combination with a Raspberry Pi device and a Pi camera, overcomes the limitations of other prototypes found in the literature. In this paper, a detailed description can be found about the schematic and characteristics of the board with a deep-learning-based insect-counting method. © 2022 by the author.},

	abstract = {The concept of Smart Cities and the monitoring of environmental parameters is an area of research that has attracted scientific attention during the last decade. These environmental parameters are well-known as important factors in their affection towards people. Massive monitoring of this kind of parameters in cities is an expensive and complex task. Recent technologies of low-cost computing and low-power devices have opened researchers to a wide and more accessible research field, developing monitoring devices for deployingWireless Sensor Networks. Gathering information from them, improved urban plans could be carried out and the information could help citizens. In this work, the prototyping of a low-cost acoustic sensor based on the Raspberry Pi platform for its use in the analysis of the sound field is described. The device is also connected to the cloud to share results in real time. The computation resources of the Raspberry Pi allow treating high quality audio for calculating acoustic parameters. A pilot test was carried out with the installation of two acoustic devices in the refurbishment works of a neighbourhood. In this deployment, the evaluation of these devices through long-term measurements was carried out, obtaining several acoustic parameters in real time for its broadcasting and study. This test has shown the Raspberry Pi as a powerful and affordable computing core of a low-cost device, but also the pilot test has served as a query tool for the inhabitants of the neighbourhood to be more aware about the noise in their own place of residence. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new emerging technology for networking that separates the forwarding and control plane. With SDN static, inflexible and complex network are replaced by dynamic, scalable, and innovative networks. The motivation of developing low-cost portable SDN switch arose when we were developing load balancing and stateful firewall SDN applications during our research work. To test and measure the performance of our applications, we needed low-cost SDN testbed. Existing solutions were utilizing special hardware such as NetFPGA or real switches. But these were not suitable due to high costs and complexity involved. We could have tested these applications using Mininet emulator but there are performance issues. In this paper, we created a small size, low cost, portable SDN switch for testing our SDN applications using Raspberry Pi. Our low-cost switch supports OpenFlow Specification 1.0–1.4. Raspberry Pi is Linux-based small size low-cost device which can be used as a personal computer as well as for making low-cost portable SDN switch. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

The entire 56x85 mm board was exposed while running Linux. Single Event Upsets, Single Event Functional Interrupts, HANGS, and Linux operating system errors were recorded along with the attendant neutron fluence. Cross sections are computed and converted to error rates. Due to frequent crashes, tests were run for one minute then terminated and a new test begun. Unsuccessful tests were detected, and power was cycled to recover initial system state. While the Linux operating system afforded several advantages in testing, it introduces difficult-to-diagnose failures and a perplexing problem on Raspberry Pi with accounting for wall-clock time.  © 2022 IEEE.},

It aims to find algorithms that excel in performance. The performance, which is a measure is the time and memory used to encrypt and decrypt with the same key-the method used in research with an experimental approach. Where experimental done on Raspberry PI with PHP programming language, the results of this study indicate that the AES algorithm requires a shorter time in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm uses a larger memory capacity in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm is recommended to use because in terms of security AES has a more significant number of keys that is 128 bits while the DES algorithm has a key length of 64 bits or half of the number of keys in the AES Algorithm. The results of the comparison of the two algorithms can be used as a reference where two encryption algorithms are compatible with the applications and devices developed. © 2019 IEEE.},

First, the noise power spectral density (PSD) is estimated by one of the speech blocking-based noise PSD es-Timators previously proposed. The adaptively estimated noise PSD in each frame is then employed in a cue-preserving MMSE-based noise-reduction spectral gain function. The objective of this demonstration is to present the capabilities of the proposed algorithms with the application for hearing AIDS in a challenging noisy environment, i.e., congress babble noise in the show-And-Tell area. The proposed solution sup-presses the noise without having prior information on noise statistics, target speaker location and voice activity detection (VAD).

	abstract = {Purpose: The value of a teaching case repository in radiology training programs is immense. The allocation of resources for putting one together is a complex issue, given the factors that have to be coordinated: hardware, software, infrastructure, administration, and ethics. Costs may be significant and cost-effective solutions are desirable. Methods: We chose Medical Imaging Resource Center (MIRC) to build our teaching file. It is offered by RSNA for free. For the hardware, we chose the Raspberry Pi, developed by the Raspberry Foundation: a small control board developed as a low cost computer for schools also used in alternative projects such as robotics and environmental data collection. Its performance and reliability as a file server were unknown to us. For the operational system, we chose Raspbian, a variant of Debian Linux, along with Apache (web server), MySql (database server) and PHP, which enhance the functionality of the server. A USB hub and an external hard drive completed the setup. Installation of software was smooth. Results: The Raspberry Pi was able to handle very well the task of hosting the teaching file repository for our division. Uptime was logged at 100 %, and loading times were similar to other MIRC sites available online. We setup two servers (one for backup), each costing just below $200.00 including external storage and USB hub. Conclusion: It is feasible to run RSNA’s MIRC off a low-cost control board (Raspberry Pi). Performance and reliability are comparable to full-size servers for the intended purpose of hosting a teaching file within an intranet environment. © 2014, CARS.},

An approach that is getting more and more attention in the IoT ecosystem is the edge-computing and one of its fundamental pieces of equipment is the edge-computing gateway (GTW), which can working as a data-processing device nearer to the things and as a bridge to the Internet, as well. The most important features for these GTWs must be robustness and efficiency and a very popular solution is to use low-cost Raspberry Pi card-size computers. Considering protocol solution, Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) communication protocol has been considered one of the most applicable to IoT because of its low-power capability. In this context, this paper describes a study about the performance evaluation of a low-power member of the Raspberry Pi family, the Raspberry Pi Zero W, working as an IoT gateway and running MQTT. The experimental results show its performance using as metrics: the processor temperature, the CPU usage level, and rate of MQTT received messages under different Quality of Services (QoS). © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a fast and secure vehicle entry system for institutions, houses, many industries and areas, by using an automated number recognition system without the use of tags or stickers. The default gate control will be able to work automatically without the need of humans and the proposed system will be able to identify the number plates of vehicles in entry gate and allow the vehicle to enter. When the car arrives, the camera will take pictures of the car. The letters and numerals on the car license plate are identified using optical character recognition (OCR) and an open CV method. The final data is used to compare with the existing data using Raspberry Pi. When the data is matched, the smart electronic gate opens and allows the car to enter; otherwise, the vehicle is barred from entering. The Raspberry Pi has a chip (SoC) with Video Core IV GPU but no solid-state drive or built-in hard disc. It is capable of image processing and uses an SD card for long-term storage and boot. If any vehicle passes the system, a picture of the car number is taken using the camera. Photocopies of license plate details are provided as it is included in the Raspberry Pi Zero processor. The Raspberry pi takes over control and checks each vehicle's verification details. Once the raspberry pi notices the vehicle details that are already available, it uses a motor to operate the gate.. Automation by using such a gate can minimize the effort of humans and can also elevate the safety level in the target area. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The main goal of this study is to develop an ultra-compact optical coherence tomography (OCT) system operated by a single-board computer to enhance its on-field applicability with superior user-friendliness and minimized system complexity. The conceptual breakthrough of this demonstration is the development of an OCT using a simple Raspberry Pi single-board computer architecture (RB-OCT) that works in a similar manner as the conventional OCT systems. The unique feature of the developed all-in-one RB-OCT system is the versatile ultra-compactness, comprising all key components of an OCT system. To further enhance the miniaturization, the micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) scanning unit, the entire optical configuration, and signal generating amplifier circuits were custom made to be compatible with Raspberry Pi single-board computer architecture. The dimensions of the developed system are 228 mm width, 168 mm length, and 107 mm depth with an approximate weight of 2 kg, including an image display. The software interface was developed using C++ based on Debian OS and configured using parallel programming with multi-threading. In vivo skin, ex vivo mouse cochlea, and fresh onion peels were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Based on the feasibility study, this new type of single-board architecture OCT has potential merits over conventional OCT systems to be applied as a primary imaging device in various fields. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

An evaluation is performed on the EM leakage as the device executes the AES-128 cryptographic algorithm contained in the Crypto++ library in a threaded environment. Four multi-threaded implementations are evaluated. These implementations are Portable Operating System Interface Threads, C++11 threads, Threading Building Blocks, and OpenMP threads. It is demonstrated that the various thread techniques have distinct variations in frequency and shape as EM emanations is leaked from the Raspberry Pi. Additionally, noise is introduced while the cryptographic algorithm executes. The results indicates that tt is still possible to visibly see the execution of the cryptographic algorithm. However, out of 50 occasions the cryptographic execution was not detected 32 times. It was further identified when calculating prime numbers, the cryptographic algorithm becomes hidden. Furthermore, the analysis pointed in the direction that when high prime numbers are calculated there is a window where the cryptographic algorithm can not be seen visibly in the EM spectrum. © 2017 IEEE.},

In displaying information the application is designed using python, PHP, css that runs on a single board operating system, the output is a display of a camera or PHP display. Therefore, the mirror can have different functions by applying the Fuzzy Logic method as a decision making process on the micro. This algorithm is used to translate a quantity expressed using linguistic language. In the application of intelligent systems on smart mirrors, there are three fuzzy logic processes, namely fuzzification, evaluation of rules and defuzzification. From each of these processes will affect the response of the system that is controlled.

	abstract = {Through to technique and hardware improvements, the human can handle more significant data than before. Machine learning is a way to achieve artificial intelligence, using difference algorithm to process difference type data, let the system analyzing, learning, processing data like the way of a human. The Artificial neural network has many types, such as the Recurrent Neural Network that good at handling continuity data, the situation like speech recognition, since speech is continuity, different letters combination with the various meaning, so continuity data is essential to speech recognition. Raspberry Pi is an excellent Internet of Things device because it is a kind of micro-computer, you can install the operating system in it. The function is as a base; you can expand different modules. For example, if we want to collect image information, we can install the lens module, if we’re going to obtain sound data, we need to install the microphone module. The current raspberry pi already has WIFI and Bluetooth, so the raspberry pie is currently one of the favorite choices for IoT devices. In this paper, we want to apply the technique of face recognition and speech recognition in life, using a raspberry pi to build a home security system. We proposed an architecture that combines face recognition and voice recognition to develop a home security system. Through face and voice recognition, we double-checking the identity is correct or not to improve convenience and security of the smart home environment. Raspberry Pi is the home security system’s kernel and uses lens module to collect face information and microphone module to collect voice information. Raspberry Pi upload the data to the face API and speaker recognition system. The face API is used to recognize face information; the speech API is used to identify voice information. When the identity of the face API result is equal to the character of the speech API result, it is completing the verification requirement; the system will continue next step to control devices, like an electronic lock or other devices that supported remote control. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Parking slots have become a widespread problem in urban development. In this context, the growth of vehicles inside the university's campus is rapidly outpacing the available parking spots for students and staff as well. This issue can be mitigated by the introduction of parking management for the smart campus which targets to assist individually match drivers to vacant parking slots, saving time, enhance parking space utilization, decrease management costs, and alleviate traffic congestion. This paper develops an IoT Raspberry Pi-based parking management system (IoT-PiPMS) to help staff/students to easily find available parking spots with real-time vision and GPS coordinates, all by means of a smartphone application. Our system composes of Raspberry Pi 4 B+ (RPi) embedded computer, Pi camera module, GPS sensor, and ultrasonic sensors. In the IoT-PiPMS, RPi 4 B+ is used to gather and process data input from the sensors/camera, and the data is uploaded via Wi-Fi to the Blynk IoT server. Ultrasonic sensors and LEDs are exploited to detect the occupancy of the parking spots with the support of the Pi camera to ensure data accuracy. Besides, the GPS module is installed in the system to guide drivers to locate parking areas through the Blynk App. that discovers parking spaces availability over the Internet. The system prototype is fabricated and tested practically to prove its functionality and applicability. According to the results, the IoT-PiPMS can effectively monitor the occupancy of outdoor parking spaces in the smart campus environment, and its potency in terms of updating the data to the IoT server in real-time is also validated. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {There is a significant interest in facial emotion recognition in the fields of human–computer interaction and social sciences. With the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the field of human behavioral prediction and analysis, especially human emotion, has evolved significantly. The most standard methods of emotion recognition are currently being used in models deployed in remote servers. We believe the reduction in the distance between the input device and the server model can lead us to better efficiency and effectiveness in real life applications. For the same purpose, computational methodologies such as edge computing can be beneficial. It can also encourage time-critical applications that can be implemented in sensitive fields. In this study, we propose a Raspberry-Pi based standalone edge device that can detect real-time facial emotions. Although this edge device can be used in variety of applications where human facial emotions play an important role, this article is mainly crafted using a dataset of employees working in organizations. A Raspberry-Pi-based standalone edge device has been implemented using the Mini-Xception Deep Network because of its computational efficiency in a shorter time compared to other networks. This device has achieved 100% accuracy for detecting faces in real time with 68% accuracy, i.e., higher than the accuracy mentioned in the state-of-the-art with the FER 2013 dataset. Future work will implement a deep network on Raspberry-Pi with an Intel Movidious neural compute stick to reduce the processing time and achieve quick real time implementation of the facial emotion recognition system. © 2021 by the authors.

Stanford University under International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI) program has developed first generation of sudden ionospheric detection named as SuperSID. To enable the usage of this system for community outreach space science education program, a portable and low cost system need to be developed. Raspberry Pi can be used as the main processor for the SID system. It can be easily operated without the need of a personal computer. However, the available sound card are limited and sampling rate is on 48 kHz. This limit the detection of the VLF frequency detection to approximately 22 kHz. Thus it become a limiting factor to view the VLF spectrum in a full range (3-30 kHz). To overcome this problem, a VLF receiver system with a better sound card (Audio Injector) was proposed to detect the signal in a full VLF spectrum with the objective for a better data analysis. The hardware aspects including an antenna, a preamplifier, a sound card (Audio Injector) and a microprocessor (Raspberry Pi) with LCD Touchscreen as its monitor display. The VLF acquisition software part consists of an acquisition software executable by Python programming language with additional modules that runs in Raspberry Pi. Finally a portable VLF receiver system with maximum sampling rate of 96 kHz has been developed to capture VLF signal between 3-30 kHz. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This research investigates the Electromagnetic (EM) side channel leakage of a Raspberry Pi 2 B+. An evaluation is performed on the EM leakage as the device executes the AES-128 cryptographic algorithm contained in the libcrypto++ library in a threaded environment. Four multi-threaded implementations are evaluated. These implementations are Portable Operating System Interface Threads, C++11 threads, Threading Building Blocks, and OpenMP threads. It is demonstrated that the various thread techniques have distinct variations in frequency and shape as EM emanations are leaked from the Raspberry Pi. It is demonstrated that the AES-128 cryptographic implementation within the libcrypto++ library on a Raspberry Pi is vulnerable to Side Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks. The cryptographic process was seen visibly within the EM spectrum and the data for this process was extracted where digital filtering techniques was applied to the signal. The resultant data was utilised in the Differential Electromagnetic Analysis (DEMA) attack and the results revealed 16 sub-keys that are required to recover the full AES-128 secret key. Based on this discovery, this research introduced a multi-threading approach with the utilisation of Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) to serve as a software based countermeasure to mitigate SCA attacks. The proposed countermeasure known as the FRIES noise generator executed as a Daemon and generated EM noise that was able to hide the cryptographic implementations and prevent the DEMA attack and other statistical analysis. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {When public emergencies or disasters occurred, such as fires and earthquakes, safety accidents with group trampling can easily be caused. In the previous work, the study of crowd evacuation mainly adopted artificial parameters for simulations. To overcome these problems, we propose a data-driven crowd evacuation simulation method based on Raspberry Pi. First, we configure Raspberry Pi as sensor node, which is connected the wireless WiFi network card with monitoring function and the infrared sensor module with detection function. And then the sensor node was deployed to collect real data of crowd evacuation in real scenarios. Second, the curve fitting method is used to deal with the functional relationship between crowd density and average evacuation speed. In terms of crowd evacuation simulation calculation, we present Crowd Density-based Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle (CD-RVO) algorithm which drive individual speed changes with crowd density, to optimize the options for safety exit of individuals and reduce evacuation time effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method can simulate the process of crowd evacuation realistically and improve crowd evacuation efficiency.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyse communication between Raspberry Pi 3 and a mobile robot Starter Kit 2.0 equipped with sbRIO9632 driver. Sending data between devices was carried out by the TCP / IP protocol. The first chapter discusses the issues related to the duration of algorithms that recognize objects in images. Subsequently, the measurement system is presented along with the description of the TCP / IP protocol. Next, the method of testing the connection between Raspberry Pi 3 and the mobile robot was determined. The TCP / IP protocol was chosen as a way of data exchange and the server and communication client were established. Two time measurements were used to diagnose the TCP / IP connection. The first timer was measured from the time the image was taken from the camera by digital image processing, sending data to the server response. The second timer measured the communication time (sending the packet - response). Time measurements were made in two situations: communication was via a network cable and using a router (wireless communication). The last chapter of this article was the analysis of results and conclusions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The implementation of a master and eight workers, each running on Raspberry Pi nodes, is the central component of this novel technique. Each worker is responsible for managing their own colony of ants, while the master coordinates communications among workers' nodes and assesses the most optimal approach. To put the newly built cluster through its paces, several datasets of traveling salesman problem are used to test the created cluster. The findings of the experiment indicate that a single board computer cluster, which makes use of multi-ant colony algorithm, is a viable alternative for distributed computing. This approach's extensibility options are extensively discussed as well. © 2022 University of Baghdad-College of Science. All rights reserved.},

This distributed control system is based on an array of Raspberry-Pi (RPi) modules, which is embedded in each subsystem. The RPis run the Linux operating system and they are integrated with Input/Output (I/O) circuits which carry out the control and monitoring functions. The distributed architecture gives rise to a low-cost and yet versatile and powerful setup, which can be built up gradually by adding subsystems, one at a time.

From more than couple of years it is even possible to program them using software dedicated formerly only to industrial purposes, i.e. CODESYS development platform. As a result, embedded devices are a lot cheaper alternative to Programmable Logic Controller PLC. In that case however, their temporal characteristics should be taken into consideration. Shortly speaking, one should consider the time needed for the embedded device to react to external stimulus. Moreover, the response time is not constant and depends on other tasks being realized by a given device, such as communication task.

	abstract = {Recently, Raspberry Pi has become popular around the world as an inexpensive, small, and powerful computing device. We have studied its use as the software access-point (AP) for the IEEE 802.11n wireless local-area network (WLAN), where the channel bonding (CB) can increase the throughput by bonding two channels into one. However, the built-in wireless network interface card (NIC) adapter fails to support the CB. Thus, we have configured the CB using external NIC adapters, and investigated the throughput performance and estimation model for only one link between a PC host and a Raspberry Pi AP. In this paper, we present the throughput measurement for concurrent communications of multiple links with up to three APs under different adapters and channels with 11 and 13 partially overlapping channels (POCs) at 2.4GHz. Besides, we extend the throughput estimation model by introducing the throughput drop factor to consider interferences between the links. This factor can be derived from the CB use and the assigned channels for the links. The effectiveness of the proposal is verified by comparing the estimated throughput with the measured one. © 2019 Journal of Communications.},

In order to detect vehicles, monitor and estimate traffic flow using low cost electronic devices, this research work utilizes camera module of raspberry pi along with Raspberry Pi 3. It also aims to develop a remote access using raspberry-pi to detect, track and count vehicles only when some variations occur in the monitored area. The proposed system captures video stream like vehicles in the monitored area to compute the information and transfer the compressed video stream for providing video based solution that is mainly implemented in Open CV by Python Programming.

	abstract = {Rapid and accurate counting and recognition of flying insects are of great importance, especially for pest control. Traditional manual identification and counting of flying insects is labor intensive and inefficient. In this study, a vision-based counting and classification system for flying insects is designed and implemented. The system is constructed as follows: firstly, a yellow sticky trap is installed in the surveillance area to trap flying insects and a camera is set up to collect real-time images. Then the detection and coarse counting method based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection, the classification method and fine counting based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) using global features are designed. Finally, the insect counting and recognition system is implemented on Raspberry PI. Six species of flying insects including bee, fly, mosquito, moth, chafer and fruit fly are selected to assess the effectiveness of the system. Compared with the conventional methods, the test results show promising performance. The average counting accuracy is 92.50% and average classifying accuracy is 90.18% on Raspberry PI. The proposed system is easy-to-use and provides efficient and accurate recognition data, therefore, it can be used for intelligent agriculture applications. © 2018 by the authors.

To this end, we developed a new attack tool that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi and allows novice users to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack and a small-scale Denial-of- Service attack. The first attack has been designed in such a way so that the attacker can gather credentials of legitimate users even when they try to visit websites that are running under SSL/TLS and they have enabled the HSTS protocol. Regarding the second attack, the attacker has the ability to control a set of malicious Raspberry Pi's and intentionally attempt to stop legitimate users from accessing services. The attacker can select a specific target in the network and overload the corresponding device by sending several fake requests. Throughout this work, we discovered that although security protocols have become more effective over the years it is still considerably easy to launch certain attacks with the main aim to breach users' privacy or restrict service to certain users. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {The IEEE802.11n wireless local-area network (WLAN) has been widely adopted due to the flexible coverage and lower installation cost. However, the TCP throughput unfairness was detected when multiple hosts concurrently communicate with a single access-point (AP). Previously, the authors proposed the TCP fairness control method for only two hosts in the elastic WLAN system using Raspberry Pi AP, which dynamically adapts the topology according to the traffic demand. The delay is introduced in the packet transmission to the faster host from the AP, which is optimized by the PI feedback control such that the measured throughput becomes equal between the hosts. In this paper, the authors proposed a generalization of this method for any number of hosts by newly introducing the target throughput as the equal goal among the hosts. It is dynamically updated using the measured throughputs. The effectiveness of the proposal is verified through experiments using the elastic WLAN system testbed with one AP and up to four hosts.

	abstract = {In auditory behavioral and EEG experiments, the variability of stimulation solutions, for both software and hardware, adds unnecessary technical constraints. Currently, there is no easy to use, inexpensive, and shareable solution that could improve collaborations and data comparisons across different sites and contexts. This article outlines a system composed by a Raspberry Pi coupled with Python programming and associated with a HifiBerry sound card. We compare its sound performances with those of a wide variety of materials and configurations. This solution achieves the high timing accuracy and sound quality important in auditory cognition experiments, while being simple to use and open source. The present system shows high performances and results along with excellent feedback from users. It is inexpensive, easy to build, share, and improve on. Working with such low-cost, powerful, and collaborative hardware and software tools allows people to create their own specific, adapted, and shareable system that can be standardized across different collaborative sites, while being extremely simple and robust in use. © 2021.

	abstract = {Security and monitoring are extremely important in our current society. An efficient monitoring system aids in the analysis of stranded places where humans are unable to access. We intend to construct a surveillance robot that can conduct both active and passive surveillance, with an autonomous patrol mode and a manual mode that alerts the operator when motion is detected. The surveillance system can travel within the surveillance area, allowing more areas of interest to be viewed with the least amount of surveillance equipment possible on a limited budget. Furthermore, acquiring relevant data becomes much easier than surveillance monitoring is adaptable with numerous sensors like humidity/ digital temperature/ sonic/ air quality/ smoke sensors, etc., that may be used for diverse applications. Using the internet as a communication medium, the robotic car can function as both an autonomous and a manually operated vehicle. This multimodal robot was designed to sense the presence of an enemy, capture it on camera, and broadcast it live to an authorised person. Surveillance plays a big role while we're operating on the border, and there's a robot for that. This paper shows how to build a smart surveillance robot for military use utilising a Raspberry Pi for security. A Raspberry Pi field delivers a wireless command, which is received by an authorised user on a web page, and the robot moves as a result. The Raspberry Pi camera is used to stream the video. The Raspberry Pi is programmed in the Python programming language. The video streamed at a rate of up to 15 frames per second, according to the results of the trial. © 2022 IEEE.},

Due to tongue movements, the magnetic field inside and around the mouth get varied. The variations are detected by three pair axial linear magneto-inductive sensor modules mounted bilaterally on a headset. Using raspberry-pi, the information is wirelessly transmitted to a portable screen.

	abstract = {The need for semi-autonomous garbage collector is essential and it is high demand. The need of this is mainly due to which it can reduce human effort and time saving also. A computer vision technology based garbage collector can be developed and utilized for the betterment of social well-being. The proposed system is subdivided into 3 categories, Lane Detection during transportation, Object Detection, GPS for sensing and navigating purpose. The garbage can is installed with ultrasonic sensor to identify whether the can is full or empty. If the garbage can gets filled it send message to the self-driving car Through Node MCU present in the car. The controller used in garbage can is also Node MCU which provides wireless communication between the car and the garbage-can. During motion pi-cam captures the images of lane and objects and it is processed using algorithms. Aar Cascade Classifier is used for detecting stop sign, traffic light, garbage-can, object detection within lane. Raspberry pi acts as master device and Arduino act as slave. Parallel mode of communication is employed. Depending upon the direction predicted by Raspberry Pi, Arduino will send signals to Motor driver and the motor will control the wheel and direction of motion. Location of the garbage-can is identified using GPS. Once destination is reached, Raspberry pi detects garbage-can. After detecting, Arduino Uno sends signal to robotic arm and the arm picks up the garbage-can and returns to the garbage collection centre. © 2021},

The major challenge in implementing the algorithms on IoT devices is a lack of computational power. The major challenge in implementing the algorithms on IoT devices is a lack of computational power. The state-of-the-art methods run successfully in high-end computing units, are typically not used in Raspberry pi, considered as an IoT device. This paper aims to design an authorized door lock system using the framework Raspberry pi. Instead of Euclidean distance-based similarity measure between the test and the trained face images, here for face identification the pretrained FACENET model is used that reduces the false cases. In the current approach, Haar-Cascade is used to detect the faces and next we train the fully connected layers on the collected facial embeddings of FACENET. The proposed Haar-Cascade FACENET Fully Connected Face Authentication (HFFCFA) model eliminates the faults which occur in the Euclidean-based approach, thus reducing false positive and false negative cases. The network model works perfectly together with the Raspberry Pi pipeline for face recognition. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Implementation of this scenario needs following topics to be addressed. For controlling and capturing the video, Raspberry provides the console application raspivid which can be executed with parameters specifying how the video shall be captured. You can specify parameters like width, height or frames per seconds as if the video be produced to a file to out. The service application implemented in this example internally uses the raspivid. For video capturing the service starts raspivid and then reads incoming video data from raspivid's out. The service executes raspivid with above specified parameters. Live video data continuously coming from raspivid's out needs to be transferred across the network to the connected client. To transfer the data for inter-process communication the implementation uses the lightweight cross-platform library. The communication is based directly on duplex channels to avoid serialization or deserialization. It means the service application running on Raspberry Pi uses input duplex channel and the.NET client running on PC as output channel. When a raspivid's out provides chunk of video data, the service uses the duplex channels to send data to connected clients. Then it uses output channel to receive the video data and to notify it for further processing. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Raspberry Pi and its variants have brought with them an aura of change in the world of embedded systems. With their impressive computation and communication capabilities and low footprint,these devices have thrown open the possibility of realizing a network of things in a very cost-effective manner. While such networks offer good solutions to prominent issues,they are indeed a long way from being smart or intelligent. Most of the currently available implementations of such a network of devices involve a centralized cloud-based server that contributes to making the necessary intelligent decisions,leaving these devices fairly underutilized. Though this paradigm provides for an easy and rapid solution,they have limited scalability,are less robust and at times prove to be expensive. In this paper,we introduce the concept of Agents on Raspberry Pi (AgPi) as a cyber solution to enhance the smartness and flexibility of such embedded networks of physical devices in a decentralized manner. The use of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) running on Raspberry Pis aids agents,both static and mobile,to govern the various activities within the network. Agents can act autonomously or on behalf of a human user and can collaborate,learn,adapt and act,thus contributing to embedded intelligence. This paper describes how Tartarus,a multi-agent platform,embedded on Raspberry Pis that constitute a network,can bring the best out of the system. To reveal the versatility of the concept of AgPi,an application for a Location-Aware and Tracking Service (LATS) is presented. The results obtained from a comparison of data transfer cost between the conventional cloud-based approach with AgPi have also been included. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI,Basel,Switzerland.},

While this enhanced connectivity will definitely improve our quality of life, it also raises serious security, privacy, trustworthiness questions, the resource constrained nature of IoT entities makes traditional security techniques impractical. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection architecture for the IoT. We discuss the feasibility of employing a commodity device as the core component of the architecture. In particular, we evaluated the performance of the Raspberry Pi, one of the most used commodity single-board computers, while running Snort, a widely known, open source Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

	abstract = {Due to the increasing number of crimes and the increasing number of people living in cities, the requirement for a reliable and effective surveillance security system is spreading worldwide. Due to the continuous recording and the manpower required to monitor the activities of unauthorized individuals, the security systems consume a lot of memory and are not able to provide instant notification. In comparison to current monitoring systems, the Raspberry Pi has a number of advantages. Its mobility is one among them. This research work has introduced an Internet-based monitoring system that can be accessed remotely via the internet. This paper will look at how a PIR sensor and image processing may be used to monitor and track objects. Live video streams will be used to demonstrate how this can be accomplished. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To measure biosignals constantly, using textile-integrated or even textile-based electrodes and miniaturized electronics, is ideal to provide maximum comfort for patients or athletes during monitoring. While in former times, this was usually solved by integrating specialized electronics into garments, either connected to a handheld computer or including a wireless data transfer option, nowadays increasingly smaller single circuit boards are available, e.g., single-board computers such as Raspberry Pi or microcontrollers such as Arduino, in various shapes and dimensions. This review gives an overview of studies found in the recent scientific literature, reporting measurements of biosignals such as ECG, EMG, sweat and other health-related parameters by single circuit boards, showing new possibilities offered by Arduino, Raspberry Pi etc. in the mobile long-term acquisition of biosignals.

The controlling is done by minutely observing the important parameters which generate vital pieces of information concerning the functioning of these electronic devices. Simultaneously, this information will transmit these vital statistics from the transmitting device as well as save the same on the cloud to access by the applications and supplementary procedures to use them. This scrutiny associates the outcomes of the environmental observances like the humidity and temperature measurements using sensors. The gathered information could be profitably used to produce actions like distantly dominant cooling, heating devices, or long term statistics, which will be useful to control the same. The detected data are uploaded to the cloud storage through network and associate using android application. The system employs Arduino UNO with Raspberry Pi, HTU 211D sensor device, and an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The experimental results show the live temperature and humidity of the surroundings and the soil moisture of any plant using Arduino UNO with Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is mainly used here for checking the temperature and humidity through the HTU 211D sensor element. The sensors are used for measuring the temperatures from the surroundings, storing displayed information with different devices.

The components we used in our system ensures overall fecund, scalable and spirited implementation. Depending upon the moisture level of farmland and daylight intensity, the system can detect the appropriate time of water supply in the trees and can also keep track of the water level to prevent water from being accumulated around the roots of the saplings. The analog data received from the sensors are transmitted by Arduino as digital signal via Wifi Module to the Raspberry Pi 3. The system is able to notify the administrator if water shortage arises in the main water supply and an administrator can also communicate with the system by sending SMS (Short message service) of a particular keyword. This system can be applied in farmland as well as small pot plants. Using this system, a very promising outcome is found in sustaining and cherishing the plants in a more scientific way. © 2016 IEEE.},

Though there exist enough remedies to the problems of assisting individuals who are visually impaired to read, there is a requirement for an intelligent text reader which is economical, accurate and easily accessible in order to help them read for day to day activities. This paper proposes an intelligent text reader using python. This product is built on a Raspberry Pi module connected with camera that is used to capture the input image. The input image is enhanced using Image processing techniques. The Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine embedded in the Raspberry Pi searches for the text in an improved image and converts it into digital document. The digital document is then analyzed using semantic check module. After the analysis, text is converted to speech by a Python based TTS (text to speech) conversion unit embedded in the Raspberry Pi. Finally, the audio output is given to the Audio Amplifier for it to be read out. © 2020 IEEE.},

SiriProxy is installed on the Raspberry Pi as a proxy server for Siri. By developing a SiriProxy plug-in, a set of commands for home automation could be custom-made by the user. The system has been tested and verified through speech recognition's accuracy tests, response latency tests and success rate tests. A total of 34 subjects with different English accents tested a total of 14 voice commands with a total of 390 trials. The tests verified that the system's average latency is at 2.12 seconds with an overall success rate at 93.3333% on at least 3 trials and 87.381% success rate on at least one trial. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The influence of identity verification in mobile application have attracted significant attention and growth to mobile technology development. So far, there are various methods involving identity verification in mobile application development, yet, it was still considered challenging and have been a primary study due to its limitation to memory allocation and the computing power. Subsequently, to address these issues there are different algorithms that were designed for identity verification to adopt the mobile environment and to resolve the arising challenges. In this paper, we proposed a novel, cost-effective and energy-efficient framework by introducing a mobile-based identity verification on offline-mode using the Raspberry Pi framework. A Raspberry Pi device is wirelessly connected to mobile phone to process the face detection and face verification. The proposed method is implemented on the latest version of Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ version run in Python 3.7 where the datasets and training sets images were experimented and tested using LBP algorithms for face detection and face verification. With the experimental test result using the confusion matrix in a multiclass classification, the proposed method showed a results of 87.5% accuracy score, 88% in terms of precision, 88% recall score and 86% F1 score. In addition, the experimental test were done using 3000 images in a controlled/unconstrained environment, were 20% or 600 of the images were used as data sets. During the offline mode testing, the face detection and verification has resulted to an average timing of 4.98 seconds. Thus, it concludes the feasibility to implement face verification system in the Philippine government services such as the voting system, road check-point, driver's ID verification to name a few. © 2019 Kohat University of Science and Technology.

It mimics fly's eye technique with a microlens array, which will view the scene at a slightly different angle to its adjacent lens that records three-dimensional information onto two-dimensional surface. To date, holoscopic 3D camera adaptors are designed and prototyped for a large scale SLR cameras. This paper proposes an innovative design solution for prototyping a holoscopic 3D camera adaptor for Raspberry Pi, which is a credit-card-sized single board computer.

	abstract = {Solar energy is extracted from photovoltaic (PV) panels by semiconductor materials used in the system. However, the PV panel efficiency is low. Moreover, inaccurate determination of optimum fixed tilt angle of the panels, some environmental factors such as dirt and dust and solar radiation level and temperature variations depending on the seasonal changes decrease the panel efficiency. In the study, PV panels were placed at 10°, 20°, 30°, 40°, 50° and 60° tilt angles and the monthly, seasonally and yearly optimum tilt angles for Bilecik city were determined. Therefore, it was determined at which tilt angle the maximum power is extracted from PV panels. The record and the storage of the voltage, current and the power data obtained from PV panels is provided by Raspberry Pi card. Moreover, the obtained data is open to access on the internet by a web server set up on Raspberry Pi. Therefore, the data can be watched live in any computer with an internet access. Annual measurements were performed by the designed system and the data was recorded with the date and time data. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new design of cognitive radio (CR) system based on a reconfigurable filtenna, RF power detector, and Raspberry pi is proposed. It provides a fast and cheap solution to efficiently detect the spectrum holes over the frequency range from 2.37 to 3.69 GHz. The frequency scanning is performed by using a compact narrow bandwidth filtenna. The electrical frequency reconfiguration is achieved by incorporating a varactor diode into the filtenna structure. Under the control of Raspberry pi, the frequency tuning is done by varying the voltage across the varactor from 0 to 30 Volts. Followed by the filtenna, an RF power detector circuit is utilized to monitor the primary user (PU) existence. Different scenarios of measurements are carried out to verify the reliability and successfulness of the proposed prototype. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {An individual Human computer interference system is being introduced. In olden times, as an input device the mouse and keyboard were used by human computer interference system. Those people who are suffering from certain disease or illness cannot be able to operate computers. The idea of controlling the computers with the eyes will serve a great use for handicapped and disabled person. Also this type of control will eliminate the help required by other person to handle the computer. This measure will be the most useful for the person who is without hands through which they can operate with the help of their eye movements. The movement of the cursor is directly associated with the center of the pupil. Hence our first step would be detecting the center of point pupil. This process of pupil detection is implemented using the Raspberry Pi and OpenCV. The Raspberry Pi has a SD/MMC card slot which is used for placing the SD card. The SD card is boosted with the operating system that is required starting up of Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry PI will get executed once the application program is loaded into it. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In today’s world we all have encountered the problem of huge and messy traffic at some or another time. Sometimes this traffic is caused by number of vehicles running and sometimes by slow manual processing. The best example of traffic generated by human processing is on toll tax gates, every highways have number of toll tax gates which collect revenue for the maintenance of the highways, now one by one from each vehicle tax is collected which creates a long queue and exhausts so much of time as well as fuel, the aim of this paper is to identify the feasible technologies for eco e – Toll Tax System. To overcome existing issues in the current implementation of the Toll system, this paper implements Bluetooth based e- toll prototype. The paper also discusses about the human made errors during toll-tax collection and it will also propose the method of unmanned toll-tax gate. The prototype is based on ATmega 328 which has been programmed by Arduino platform and Raspberry-Pi is used for managing the database and internet connectivity from the main server. The prototype is capable of making contact with the driver using Bluetooth technology and deducts the tax online, it also updates the whole transaction through raspberry pi LAMP server on the main database. © RJPT.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud computing technologies are together serving different Health Care applications. These applications suffer from slower decision-making due to network delays, less availability of bandwidth, transmission delays, processing delays, and data de-noising. To avoid this, Fog computing can be applied as a middle layer between the IoT and Cloud layers. Here, to understand the Fog computing and its characteristics applications along with its advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. Fog computing greatly reduces transmission delays, but Fog devices lag in computing capabilities due to their limited processing power. This can be solved by deploying multiple devices and synchronizing their computation to enable parallel execution. In this paper, a single Raspberry Pi is used as a Fog node and multiple such Raspberry Pis are deployed in the cluster form. The Dispy Python framework is used to allow parallel processing. Scalability is easy to achieve with Dispy, and also it provides different features like automated node discovery, job distribution, processing function distribution, remote access, and enhanced security. The system is proposed and implemented to test the hypothesis that it improves the real-time computation in health care applications. The final results are compared with a traditional processing system and it is found that the Raspberry PI cluster, and Dispy can enhance the computation performance in Health Care © 2020 IEEE.},

The proposed method is a stand-alone IoT system to measure few weather parameters at a dense location with heavy traffic and provide the corresponding live data. The system uses a low-power mini-computer Raspberry Pi 3B+. The various sensors are used to sense different parameters like temperature, pressure, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and humidity. The data collected by the Raspberry Pi is sent to the cloud and stored which can be viewed by anyone and anywhere at any time.

	abstract = {To ensure the safety of subway and maintain a good operating environment is the primary task of station operating units. Therefore, the environmental and passenger detection of the key locations in the subway station is necessary, to obtain real-time information such as the air quality status in the station and the density of passenger at the station hall layer and the platform layer. Station operation management department can adjust the station operation and emergency plan in real time according to the various data and information inside the station to improve the security of passengers and property in the station. The traditional detection system performs data processing on the server and has too high requirements for the server. The raspberry Pi as an embedded device have abilities of environment detection, data processing and information transmission on the local area. Multiple Raspberry Pi can be distributed at the key locations in the subway station, sending processed detection data to the server through wireless ways, which can greatly reduce the requirements of the server performance of the station monitoring system. In order to realize air quality detection and passenger detection in station, this paper designs a distributed detection system based on Raspberry Pi 4 platform.

	abstract = {Object recognition method is a computer vision technique for identifying objects in images. The main purpose of this system build is to put an end to blindness by constructing automated hardware with Raspberry Pi that enables a visually impaired person to detect objects or persons in front of them instantly, and inform what is in front of them through audio. Raspberry Pi receives data from a camera then processes it. In addition, the blind will listen to a voice narration via an audio receiver. This paper’s key objective is to provide the blind with cost-effective smart assistance to explore and sense the world independently. The second objective is to provide a convenient portable device allows users to recognise objects without touch, having the system determine the object in front of them. The camera module attached in Raspberry Pi will capture image and the processor will then process it. Subsequently, the processed image sends data to the audio receiver narrating the detected object(s). This system will be very useful for a blind person to explore the world by listening to the voice narration. The generated voice narration after processing the image will help the blind to visualise objects in front of them. © 2022.

Reed–Solomon codes are represented as RS (n = 23, k = 17) block codes. The encoder takes input symbol data (k = 17) and adds ‘n − k’ (t = 6) redundant information. The parity bits/symbols contribute an ‘n’ (23) symbol code word. A Reed–Solomon decoder capacity of correction is up to ‘t’ (3) symbols of the code word, where 2t = n− k (6). The output of the encoder is n symbols comprising of ‘n − k’ parity symbols and k information symbols. The burst error is the condition due to noise interference in the digital data due to reasons such as thunder, white noise, and scratch on a DVD which can be handled optimistically by the proposed block codes. The proposed RS coder and decoder will be able to detect the error and recover the original data from redundant information during encoding. The algorithm is being developed and implemented using Raspberry Pi using Python programming; various test sequences are given as input to the system with and without error to evaluate the error-correcting capability of the system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Biometric authentication, the process of verification using unique biological characteristics, is considered one of the most accurate technologies for authentication. It compares two or more biometric data to identify the differences among them properly. Based on the comparison between individual's biometric features and stored authorized features, it makes the decision of matched or mismatched. If the given sample of the biometric data matches with the stored one, authorization is confirmed. Nowadays, many real-time applications use biometric authentication to meet security purposes fully. However, it is difficult to implement fingerprint recognition system specially on Linux based computer. A well-known, less costly embedded computer called Raspberry Pi is used to build the entire system. Fingerprint enrollment, fingerprint recognition, photo capture, QR code generation as well as QR code reading were entirely done using python and python associated libraries. For storage management, we have used MySQL as it is convenient and open-source. This paper discusses about a quality authentication model which is highly capable and cost- effective. The authentication process consists of extracting the biometric features with ORB algorithm, matching those features using FLANN matcher, generating and validating QR code based on encrypted personal information accurately. Here, AES algorithm is used for encrypting personal data which is then converted and stored in form of QR code. Final authentication process involves both fingerprint and QR code validation. Performing two factor authentication affixes more reliability to the system. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Applications making use of embedded systems are anticipated to become extremely important as we advance towards realizing the vision of 'Internet of Things' with smart devices such as Raspberry Pi, and compute-anywhere paradigm where principles of distributed systems play pivotal roles. A case we envision here is a distributed network of low powered devices to accomplish various tasks autonomously. Driven by a distributed embedded system architecture, each of the devices can work on independent local data, which is device specific, to perform similar compute tasks simultaneously so a common goal can be achieved. This collaborative problem solving in the embedded setting is similar in concept to the big data paradigm now commonly proposed for commodity hardware and large databases. As the embedded devices become more capable and powerful the two concepts will combine. However, they are currently worlds apart, and thus forms the motivation of our research. In this project, a middleware layer is developed and tested to make the devices work collaboratively on local data within a network of Raspberry Pi devices. The middleware layer splits, distributes, computes and merges the computing tasks to accomplish a shared computing goal while performing the operations locally in a 'shared nothing' architecture. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is a technology of wireless optical communication, which combines lighting and communication simultaneously. In indoor VLC system, both data communication and lighting quality plays an important role and must be considered. Thus, to achieve the desired levels of illumination, dimming control in VLC is an efficient technology. In this paper, the authors have designed and implemented a dimming control VLC system employing multi header-hybrid pulse position modulation (MH-HPPM) to achieve dimming functionality. MH-HPPM supports various dimming levels and also doesn’t have flicker problems. In this paper, the authors present the implementation of MH-HPPM based VLC system using Raspberry Pi. The prototype is designed using low-cost commodity hardware. Comprehensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of MH-HPPM based VLC under dimming levels 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75. The results demonstrate that designed prototype supports a communication distance up to 3 m for dimming level 0.25 and 3.5 m for dimming level 0.5 and 0.75. It is also observed that MH-HPPM based VLC system also achieves and maintains better throughput for different incidence angle. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Kiosks are mostly designed using closed source hardwares [5] and thus they are very costly. Using open source platforms like Arduino and Raspberry pi, the manufacturing cost of kiosks can be comparatively reduced. Thus this Outpass system generates outpass with the help of the web kiosk [14] that run an embedded Linux operating system (Arbian) [7]. The existing systems are E-Outpass system, E-gate, E-gatepass for IT Park. These devices are used for product tracking, maintaining [15] the entry and exit of IT employees and other organizations. These systems are kiosk machines which cannot run like normal desktop machines. ARM [6] based fan less processors has revolutionized the mobile computing platform and it is fast. In the same way, this outpass system will also invokes a kiosk operating system which is created from the ARM based Linux kernel and named as Arbian Operating system [8]. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

	abstract = {Measuring friction between the tyres of a vehicle and the road, often and on as many locations on the road network as possible, can be a valuable tool for ensuring traffic safety. Rather than by using specialised equipment for sequential measurements, this can be achieved by using several low-cost measuring devices on vehicles that travel on the road network as part of their daily assignments. The presented work proves the hypothesis that a low cost measuring device can be built and can provide measurement results comparable to those obtained from expensive specialised measuring devices. As a proof of concept, two copies of a prototype device, based on the Raspberry Pi single-board computer, have been developed, built and tested. They use accelerometers to measure vehicle braking deceleration and include a global positioning receiver for obtaining the geolocation of each test. They run custom-developed data acquisition software on the Linux operating system and provide automatic measurement data transfer to a server. The operation is controlled by an intuitive user interface consisting of two illuminated physical pushbuttons. The results show that for braking tests and friction coefficient measurements the developed prototypes compare favourably to a widely used professional vehicle performance computer. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background Rodent models of neurological disease such as stroke are often characterized by motor deficits. One of the tests that are used to assess these motor deficits is the tapered beam test, which provides a sensitive measure of bilateral motor function based on foot faults (slips) made by a rodent traversing a gradually narrowing beam. However, manual frame-by-frame scoring of video recordings is necessary to obtain test results, which is time-consuming and prone to human rater bias. New method We present a cost-effective method for automated touch sensing in the tapered beam test. Capacitive touch sensors detect foot faults onto the beam through a layer of conductive paint, and results are processed and stored on a Raspberry Pi computer. Results Automated touch sensing using this method achieved high sensitivity (96.2%) as compared to ‘gold standard’ manual video scoring. Furthermore, it provided a reliable measure of lateralized motor deficits in mice with unilateral photothrombotic stroke: results indicated an increased number of contralesional foot faults for up to 6 days after ischemia. Comparison with existing method The automated adaptation of the tapered beam test produces results immediately after each trial, without the need for labor-intensive post-hoc video scoring. It also increases objectivity of the data as it requires less experimenter involvement during analysis. Conclusions Automated touch sensing may provide a useful adaptation to the existing tapered beam test in mice, while the simplicity of the hardware lends itself to potential further adaptations to related behavioral tests. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The internet has turned out to be a reliable tool for communication, data transfer and many more applications for people from all over the world. An individual's internet activities are being tracked and traced without their knowledge by various means. Thus, online security is a genuine worry for web clients who intend to visit interpersonal interaction locales, make an online transaction, or take an interest in internet diversions, as they need their protection to be ensured. Internet browsing is not anonymized as many Internet Service Providers (ISP‟s) could legally sell users information without informing users. People‟s internet activities are being tracked and traced by ISPs. Moreover, network spies and snooping attempts are very hard to be defeated as an ample network snooping tools are available in the market. These issues can be curbed by using a router that has anonymous browsing infrastructure. However, most of the routers that gives anonymous browsing are not portable. From this project, people will be able to browse anonymously without being traced. Besides that, network snooping and spying attempts can be defeated. Finally, a portable The Onion Routing (TOR) router can be created with a Raspberry Pi.. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {This research investigates the Electromagnetic (EM) side channel leakage of a Raspberry Pi 2 B+. An evaluation is performed on the EM leakage as the device executes the AES-128 cryptographic algorithm contained in the libcrypto++ library in a threaded environment. Four multi-threaded implementations are evaluated. These implementations are Portable Operating System Interface Threads, C++11 threads, Threading Building Blocks, and OpenMP threads. It is demonstrated that the various thread techniques have distinct variations in frequency and shape as EM emanations are leaked from the Raspberry Pi. It is demonstrated that the AES-128 cryptographic implementation within the libcrypto++ library on a Raspberry Pi is vulnerable to Side Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks. The cryptographic process was seen visibly within the EM spectrum and the data for this process was extracted where digital filtering techniques was applied to the signal. The resultant data was utilised in the Differential Electromagnetic Analysis (DEMA) attack and the results revealed 16 sub-keys that are required to recover the full AES-128 secret key. Based on this discovery, this research introduced a multi-threading approach with the utilisation of Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) to serve as a software based countermeasure to mitigate SCA attacks. The proposed countermeasure known as the FRIES noise generator executed as a Daemon and generated EM noise that was able to hide the cryptographic implementations and prevent the DEMA attack and other statistical analysis. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the development of network technology and the development of real estate industry, intelligent apartments are becoming more and more popular. The intelligent door lock equipment is becoming more and more popular. Compared with the traditional door lock, the intelligent door lock has higher security and convenience. The user controls the door lock through the mobile device, and the apartment controls the door lock through the computer. Compared with the traditional apartment door lock or electronic access card, it is more convenient. Therefore, a management system that can manage the door locks intelligently through the Internet is of great significance to the real estate industry and social development. In this paper, using the existing knowledge of electronic door lock in the industry, combined with the author's professional ability, an intelligent door lock management system based on raspberry pie, Java EE and Android is designed. The door lock end is controlled by raspberry pie, which scans fingerprint data and enters fingerprint data by as608 fingerprint module. Rpi-lcd35b display screen is used as password input interface, RPI camera is used as monitoring equipment of door lock. Raspberry pie controls electronic door lock and sends door opening record to server. Users can get the information of the door lock through the mobile app, modify the door lock password, save the household information and perform other operations, which can be monitored by the camera on the door lock. © 2021 ACM.},

This reserch have been applied in two public schools from Araranguá/SC that also face difficulties when using the computer lab. As a solution, the students use their own mobile devices to do science and physics experiments accessing, controlling and observing real experiments installed in the Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab).

	abstract = {Technology has changed the world. There is a huge growth in technology connected to almost every field. The pace and diversity of advancement is very rapid. Hence, new technology and techniques are coming up and are put to use as per the need. In such advanced scenario, providing security to home has also become a major point of concern. Presently security cameras can be used for the same. But such cameras may be visible to intruders and there is possibility that cameras may be damaged. Hence, in order to serve the purpose, there is a need to find an alternative secure, accurate and quick method. Hence, an effort is made in this paper to design a home security system using Raspberry Pi. System requires Raspberry Pi, Camera, Touch screen and android mobile as hardware components. Python, Node.js and OpenCV libraries are used for software coding. Usually most of the intrusion detection systems click the photo of intruders as soon as the human is detected. But, such systems fail to click photos, so that the intruder can be identified (Face View Photo) and visible. In proposed system, a proper illustrative method is proposed so that the intrusion detection is accurate and photos thus captured are clear, so that intruder is clearly visible. The proposed system is designed as a smart mirror which will provide both information and home security. The system is developed to accept touch and mobile commands. As soon as the intrusion is detected, an alert message along with the identifiable and clear photo (Face view) of intruder will be sent to the owner's/administrator's mobile. The mirror owner can also see the video of deployed environment through the camera fitted on smart mirror. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

This article shows the implementation and evaluation of digital signal processing algorithms on the Raspberry Pi using Python programming language for B-mode image reconstruction. The proposed steps include digital filtering, focusing delay, coherent summation, demodulation with envelope detection, and logarithmic compression. To validate the implemented algorithm, 12-bit sampled data with a frequency of 40 MHz were used. Qualitative and quantitative analyses using the Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) and the Normalized Residual Sum of Squares (NRSS) cost functions show results compatible with the reference model in Matlab and validated in previous studies. All NRMSE results were less than 10% and NRSS results were close to zero, indicating excellent agreement with the reference Matlab model. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

A current clinical standard is the use of activated clotting time, where the mechanical movement of a plunger through a whole blood-filled channel is monitored to evaluate the endpoint time of coagulation. As a rapid, simple, low-volume, and cost-effective alternative, we have developed a paper microfluidic assay and Raspberry Pi-based device with the aim of quantifying the extent of blood coagulation in response to varying doses of heparin and protamine. The flow rate of blood through the paper microfluidic channel is automatically monitored using the Python-coded edge detection algorithm. For each set of the assay, 8-$\mu\text{L}$ of fresh human whole blood (untreated and undiluted) from human subjects is loaded onto each of eight sample pads, which have been preloaded with varying amounts of heparin or protamine. The total assay time is 3-5 min including the time for sample loading and incubation. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

With the onset of the information era and the exponential growth of technologies like big data, security of private and confidential information in any form has become a challenge. Many times, these images need to be transmitted over public networks to facilitate wireless monitoring and sharing testing results with remote operators. This transmission needs to be secure to ensure the safety and confidentiality of the images, thus cryptography techniques like image steganography are required. In this prototype, we have designed, developed and tested a Raspberry Pi LAMP web server which stores images locally which are obtained using an ESP32-Cam, and which facilitates transmission using the steganography technique. There is also an option to store these images on any other widely used cloud server, and the transmission can still use steganography encryption for an extra layer of security. The stored images can only be accessed by authorized users. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus must monitor their blood glucose levels in order to control the glycaemia. Consequently, they must perform a capillary test at least three times per day and, besides that, a laboratory test once or twice per month. These standard methods pose difficulty for patients since they need to prick their finger in order to determine the glucose concentration, yielding discomfort and distress. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based framework for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring is described. The system is based on Raspberry Pi Zero (RPi) energised with a power bank, using a visible laser beam and a Raspberry Pi Camera, all implemented in a glove. Data for the non-invasive monitoring is acquired by the RPi Zero taking a set of pictures of the user fingertip and computing their histograms. Generated data is processed by an artificial neural network (ANN) implemented on a Flask microservice using the Tensorflow libraries. In this paper, all measurements were performed in vivo and the obtained data was validated against laboratory blood tests by means of the mean absolute error (10.37%) and Clarke grid error (90.32% in zone A). Estimated glucose values can be harvested by an end device such as a smartphone for monitoring purposes. © 2019 by the authors.},

How to monitor the goods in the transportation process in real time and effectively ensure the safety of them has become an urgent problem to be solved in the navigation field. The real-time monitoring system has the characteristics of unsupervised, real-time video and image transmission, it is also an important support in the shipping system. This paper first analyzes the requirements of real-time monitoring equipment in the shipping system and determines the overall structure of it. On this basis, the Raspberry Pi is selected as the intelligent hardware board, and the client module, transmission control module and server module are designed on it. The collaborative environment with both software and hardware consisting of Raspberry Pi, on-board software and server jointly establish an overall ship shipping real-time monitoring system. The system is carried out by the monitoring terminal located on the ship for data collection, basic video and image processing based on OpenCV library, then forwarding to the transmission control module, and finally to the TCP/IP protocol receiving, converting, displaying, and storing operations on the server side. Finally, real-time video surveillance function design is realized. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Herbert pendulum, an inverted-pendulum hardness tester, can measure the hardness of various types and shapes of materials from the motion of the pendulum as it swings on a specimen. However, a large experimental system is required to detect the swing angle of the pendulum during the hardness test. This study miniaturized the Herbert hardness system and investigated its accuracy. A new Herbert pendulum was developed, which is equipped with an acceleration sensor to detect the swing angle and a Raspberry Pi microcomputer to calculate the hardness. The new Herbert hardness tester achieves portability because only the pendulum is needed to perform the hardness test. The tester can connect to a personal computer and a smartphone through Wi-Fi to provide remote data transmission. The new Herbert tester was used to perform hardness tests on five kinds of Brinell hardness reference blocks. Smooth free decay curves were obtained, and the hardness was calculated from the curves.

	abstract = {Predictive maintenance techniques can determine the conditions of equipment in order to evaluate when maintenance should be performed. Thus, it minimizes the unexpected device downtime, lowers the maintenance costs, extends equipment lifecycle, etc. Therefore, this article developed a predictive maintenance mechanism with the construction of a test platform and data analysis along with machine learning. The information transmission of sensors was based on Raspberry Pi via the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) communication protocol. The sensors used for environmental sensing were implemented on the programmable interface controller and the data were stored in time sequence. A statistical analysis software platform was adopted for data preprocessing, modelling, and prediction to provide necessary maintenance decision. Using multivariate analysis users can obtain more information about the equipment’s status, and the administrator can also determine the operational situation before unexpected device anomalies. The developed modules are decisively helpful in preventing unpredictable losses, thus improving the quality of services. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) and DCS (Distributed Control System) are both famous terms in automation and they both have critical rules. There is rarely an industry in the world which are not auditing their outcome based on one of these terms. But IOT developed in recent years, mixing the functionality of these two terms has been going on too with various security challenges involved. Even some previous issues like the price of software and easy extendibility of them make the way for small industries to have their benefits. In this research paper along with the designing and comparison, two small SCADA systems for agricultural applications tries to reduce the size as well as address a zonal method to investigate the security problems. Till these days' researchers have shown lots of development to reduce the SCADA cost in different manner but, having the compact, powerful and small size host for SCADA system has not been reported before. One of the novel aspects in this design is hiring the Raspberry Pi as the smallest computer instead of PC or laptop which along with reducing the system cost can also reduce the whole design system. Besides, Web based SCADA system has been successfully designed here and used. This paper discusses the context of local as well as remote monitoring of an agricultural plant environment with the help of a Raspberry Pi network through which a SCADA System was established. This paper aims to prove that a far more efficient and cost-effective along a secure SCADA System for monitoring is possible with the lowest of efforts. So, having zonal idea will help system to achieve the aim of secure sensor monitoring without any kind of outside interference. The result shows the successful design and implementation of zonal idea as well as the perfect usage of Raspberry Pi as a small and reliable host. © 2019 IEEE.},

This development employs voice command to controls the movement of the wheelchair in different directions. The android device is used as microphone to be connected to the Google Assistant prior to data processing by the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi will then command the servo motors to act accordingly. This system offers automatic obstacle detection via the use of an infrared sensor which aids the user to apply momentary brake button upon the obstacle detection. The proposed development has been evaluated in terms of movement accuracy and system responsiveness upon the commands given, in both control mode i.e., voice controller and joystick controller. For the movement accuracy, the results indicate that the minimum accuracies are 90% and 95% for the voice recognition controller and joystick controller, respectively. For the system responsiveness, the system response in less than 1.2 seconds for the voice recognition controller and less than 0.65 seconds for the joystick controller. With this noticeable performance, the intelligent wheelchair enables users with limited control over their limbs to maneuver the wheelchair using voice commands. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Rapid screening of pathogenic bacteria contaminated foods is crucial to prevent food poisoning. However, available methods for bacterial detection are still not ready for in-field screening because culture is time-consuming; PCR requires complex DNA extraction and ELISA lacks sensitivity. In this study, a microfluidic biosensor was developed for rapid, sensitive and automatic detection of Salmonella using metal-organic framework (MOF) NH2-MIL-101(Fe) with mimic peroxidase activity to amplify biological signal and Raspberry Pi with self-developed App to analyze color image. First, the target bacteria were separated and concentrated with the immune magnetic nanobeads (MNBs), and labeled with the immune MOFs to form MNB-Salmonella-MOF complexes. Then, the complexes were used to catalyze colorless o-phenylenediamine and H2O2 to produce yellow 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). Finally, the image of the catalysate was collected under the narrow-band blue light and analyzed using the Raspberry Pi App to determine the bacterial concentration. The experimental results showed that this biosensor was able to detect Salmonella Typhimurium from 1.5 × 101 to 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL in 1 h with the lower detection limit of 14 CFU/mL. The mean recovery for Salmonella in spiked chicken meats was ~112%. This biosensor integrating mixing, separation, labelling and detection onto a single microfluidic chip has demonstrated the merits of automatic operation, fast reaction, less reagent and small size, and is promising for in-field detection of foodborne bacteria. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

For these types of networks,strategies and mechanisms based on network coding have appeared as an alternative to overcome these difficulties in a holistic manner,e.g.,without sacrificing the benefit of a given network metric when improving another. There has been recurrent issues on: (i) making large-scale deployments akin to the Internet of Things; (ii) assessing and (iii) replicating the obtained results in preliminary studies. Therefore,finding testbeds that can deal with large-scale deployments and not lose historic data in order to evaluate these mechanisms are greatly needed and desirable from a research perspective. However,this can be hard to manage,not only due to the inherent costs of the hardware,but also due to maintenance challenges. In this paper,we present the required key steps to design,setup and maintain an inexpensive testbed using Raspberry Pi devices for communications and storage networks with network coding capabilities.

	abstract = {The paper presents laboratory exercises that complement the lectures in the Automatic Control course, which is an elective course of the 1st Cycle Professional Study Programme in Applied Electrical Engineering at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana. The laboratory exercises are designed to provide students with practical aspects in the field of automatic control. The focus is on the basic concepts of a programmble logic controller (PLC) programming by implementing an IoT-compatible, student-oriented approach using the Raspberry Pi, the PiFace Digital 2 module, and the Codesys environment. Students design a control program through developing a ladder diagram. The progressively gradually upgraded developed program, which is first tested in simulation, is finally implemented on an elevator laboratory device. The students set up a remote control via the Modbus protocol, which connects the Raspberry Pi to a Siemens S7-1200 PLC. A major advantage of the presented laboratory exercises is that students can adjust the level of difficulty according to their experience and ambitions. The basic solution is relatively quick and easy to achieve, while more advanced solutions require significant commitment and can become quite complex. According to student feedback, the exercises are fun and enhance learning.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The five daily Muslim prayer times namely Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha vary from place to place and from day to day and are uneven for locations with same time zones. The exact timing of each of the prayer is important, because it is obligatory for every Muslim to perform these prayers at the correct time. This paper presents a novel idea to develop a controlling unit using Raspberry Pi that can be connected to a TV or computer LCD monitor through VGA or HDMI port to convert it into a smart mosque (masjid) display. The smart masjid display is capable of displaying the prayer times, date, day, time and temperature. The prayer time schedule can be set and calculated based on the GPS coordinates of the place or the city. Moreover, it differs than the traditional dot matrix Masjid displays since it can display from time to time several Islamic prayers (Adzkar) of morning and evening, and audible and visual announcements as pictures and videos. Furthermore, the Imam of mosque, especially in the Taraweeh prayers, can display the pages of the Holy Quran on the smart display instead of carrying the Holy Quran by hand. The developed smart masjid display can be remotely controlled using a remote controller wearable as a ring on the finger of user/Imam which allows him to remotely flip the Quran's pages presented on the display even during the prayers. The developed controlling unit which convert any TV/ computer monitors to smart masjid display is a unique product, compact, portable, and most suitable for the special requirements of the Muslim communities throughout the world and can be placed in mosques, Islamic institutions or centers, schools, and universities and anywhere in the world have Muslim people. © 2018 IEEE.},

Therefore, these are included in the contents of the subject 'Advanced Sensor Network Infrastructure' of the Master on Intelligent Systems on Energy and Transport of the University of Seville. This subject serves as an introduction to sensor networks, their applications, and their operating principles. Its schedule includes laboratory lessons in which the students use various sensor devices for learning about the existing communication and processing methods. The health crisis caused by the COVID-19 has made difficult that all the students have physical access to the laboratory at the same time, which forced to adapt the existing materials and facilities. In this sense, to solve this problem, a Raspberry Pi-based computer network has been deployed to allow the emulation of a sensor network while providing external remote access to the students for them to perform their laboratory tasks. At the same time, this proposal has expanded the subject contents to cover several data processing layers and architectures. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The technological and scientific advancement in the field of agriculture has opened a new era for design and development of modern devices for plant health monitoring. The analysis of various parameters, which affects the plant health such as soil temperature, moisture level and pH are easier with the use of advanced devices like Raspberry Pi and Arduino integrated with different types of sensors. The development of infragram technology has created new possibilities to capture infragram images, where both infrared and visible reflectance are obtained in a single image. The rationale of this paper is to monitor the health of a small scale aquaponics vegetation using Infragram technology and Raspberry Pi. The proposed experimental setup captures infragram images using a low cost modified web camera containing infra-blue filter. These images are post-processed to calculate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is a good indicator of photosynthetic activity in plants. The study also assesses and monitors the influence of various parameters in the aquaponics system such as nitrogen usage by plants and pH change in the system under different illumination conditions. The study shows that the change in pH and health condition of the plant due to the variation in photosynthesis are the major factors that affects the balance of nitrogen cycle in the aquaponics system. © Springer India 2016.},

Typical approaches include software platforms designed for specific instruments or commercial data acquisition hardware boards, both of which require expensive licenses to use and operate. To increase the access and affordability of chromatographic data acquisition, especially for systems in which software control has become obsolete or must be written in-house, an open-source digital stripchart recorder has been developed. This system is built upon a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and a plug-in printed circuit board with the necessary integrated circuits for data acquisition. Using an open-source software called Processing, a complete user interface to control the system was developed that enables the acquisition, filtering, and processing of chromatographic data. The system performs comparably to more expensive platforms, with calculated values for peak area, retention time, and plate count all within 3% of the values calculated by a widely used commercial chromatography data software package. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, smart technologies are an important part of our action and life, both in indoor and outdoor environment. There are several smart devices very friendly to be setting, where they can be integrated and embedded with other sensors, having a very low cost. Raspberry allows to install an internal camera called Raspberry Pi Camera Module, both in RGB band and NIR band. The advantage of this system is the limited cost (< 60 euro), their light weight and their simplicity to be used and embedded. This paper will describe a research where a Raspberry Pi with the Camera Module was installed onto a UAV hexacopter based on arducopter system, with purpose to collect pictures for photogrammetry issue. Firstly, the system was tested with aim to verify the performance of RPi camera in terms of frame per second/resolution and the power requirement. Moreover, a GNSS receiver Ublox M8T was installed and connected to the Raspberry platform in order to collect real time position and the raw data, for data processing and to define the time reference. IMU was also tested to see the impact of UAV rotors noise on different sensors like accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer. A comparison of the achieved results (accuracy) on some check points of the point clouds obtained by the camera will be reported as well in order to analyse in deeper the main discrepancy on the generated point cloud and the potentiality of these proposed approach. In this contribute, the assembling of the system is described, in particular the dataset acquired and the results carried out will be analysed. © Authors 2017.},

	abstract = {The Smart mirror is a system in which the regular mirror is converted into a smart device. The Smart mirror is designed using Raspberry Pi and a touch enabled screen. The designed system is capable of acting like a regular mirror in case of normal mode of operation and it acts like a smart mirror in a triggered mode of operation. The Smart mirror thus designed is an interactive system which is capable of accepting two modes of input namely touch and mobile based controls. The system is designed to display weather information, temperature and latest news on the mirror. The system is primarily designed as a home Security and Human Monitoring system. The proposed design is thought of as a package bundled with better features, which not only just displays information over screen, but also can be used for providing security. The system is built using hardware units like Raspberry Pi 3 model, touch screen, mobile device, camera and Python coding is used for software part. The system provides security against Intrusion in home. It is done using Background Subtraction along with Simple Frame Difference Approach. Once Intrusion is detected the administrator is sent alert message along with the photo of intruder. The Human Monitoring is implemented using Machine learning technique Yolo with OpenCV. During human monitoring mode of operation, if the Human under monitoring moves out of the vision range of camera, the administrator of Smart Mirror will be sent alert message. Using the mobile commands, the administrator can see the video streaming using camera fixed on the Smart Mirror. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Multifunctional hand prostheses are one potential solution to increase patient acceptance. These require sophisticated control schemes like patternrecognition- based approaches involving classification of myoelectric signals (MES). To allow fast and flexible evaluation of prosthesis control approaches, a prototyping environment based on the Raspberry Pi and MATLAB/Simulink was created. It supports commonly applied features like RMS and zero crossings as well as classification methods like Naive Bayesian and Support Vector Machine classifiers. After classifier training with a custom MATLAB application, MES can be classified in real-time and the results employed for prosthesis actuation. The setup was tested with five participants for controlling a Michelangelo Hand. Over 90% of movements were correctly identified for three classes from two channel EMG data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

However, the practical VSN currently faces to the visual processing and transmitting problems due to the limitation of power at sensor nodes and the restriction of transmission bandwidth. In this context, the selection of a suitable video compression algorithm is utmost important task for achieving a practical VSN. To address this problem, this paper introduces a practical Raspberry Pi based High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) solution for visual sensor networks. The selected video coding solution is one of the most up-to-date compression engines but still achieving the low complexity capability.

So it is very much important to implement an effective and low cost Building Monitoring System to understand more about the building environment and energy utilization in order to take automatic adaptive decisions for better Energy consumption in the upcoming future. The overall objective of this paper is to utilize Raspberry Pi as a Key component of Building Monitoring System to Monitor the environmental parameters viz., Temperature, Barometric Pressure, humidity, Light etc and also to monitor the power consumption of the building environment in order to develop an effective environmental monitoring system which can be properly utilized in performing data analytics for Energy harvesting in the future. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {Modern memory hierarchies are complex pieces of hardware, combining memory controllers, caches, and memory-management units in a desperate attempt to keep modern high-speed processors fed with data. Recent developments, including the introduction of nonvolatile memory, further complicate the situation. Operating systems are highly tuned to current memory systems; modifying them to take advantage of new developments is a difficult process. The low-level code involved is complex and hard to follow. This makes teaching students about modern memory systems a struggle, as wading through the complicated code in a full operating system like Linux can be frustrating. To this end we develop vmwOS, a simple operating system designed for low-cost Raspberry Pi development boards. Although inexpensive, these widely used boards support most of the features of modern memory systems, including 64-bit addresses, multi-level caches, multi-core, and full ARMv8 processor and MMU support. vmwOS is simple enough that students can follow the code and make modifications for memory hierarchy exploration. We describe a number of memory research topics that can be explored with this infrastructure, including a detailed examination of simulating non-volatile RAM support. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {In today’s highly developing era, cities are getting smarter solutions for everyday problems. One such problem is about women’s safety. Recently, there has been a lot of incidence which could have been avoided if there was a reliable safety solution for women. There are many applications based on women’s safety most of which are cell phone based. The problem with these applications is that they depend on the phone’s capabilities and constraints like a battery, network, and connectivity. Thus, they somehow become unreliable in real-world scenarios. This paper focuses on creating a safety module that provides extended security to women. This paper proposes a smart solution for enhancing women safety. The proposed system is a Raspberry Pi-based module which will be a roadside unit (RSU) deployed across the city where police stations are not easily available. This module uses RFID technology to identify individuals in case of emergency. When activated, the module sends out the location of emergency to the nearest police station and to the emergency number extracted from RFID tag. It contains GPS module for location information and GSM module for sending out an alert. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

	abstract = {India is one of the democratic countries; the two major elections in India are General elections and Assembly elections. These elections are taken with the help of an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM). It is necessary to be present in the home constituency during elections, one cannot vote from another constituency to the candidate of his/her constituency. As a result, lots of people are not able to cast their votes in elections. To solve this issue there is a necessity of such a system that enables voters to vote in their respective constituency from another constituency.Digital Electronic Voting Machine (DEVM) allows voters to vote who are not available in their constituency during elections because of their employment, education, business, etc. This proposed system should be implemented in the area where the migration of people from another constituency is more. There should be a special polling booth for migrant people, where those people can cast their vote on DEVM. People of that constituency can vote in an ordinary way using EVM. This system is implemented using Raspberry Pi 4 and Touchscreen Display. The Graphical User Interface is created using Python that gives voters an option to select their home constituency to cast their vote. The system includes the candidate data of all 543 constituencies. The result of the votes is stored in the memory of Raspberry Pi with respect to the selected constituency. As a result, the voting percentage will increase which is a good sign for democracy.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Rapid advances in science and technology with exponential development of smart mobile devices, workstations, supercomputers, smart gadgets and network servers has been witnessed over the past few years. The sudden increase in the Internet population and manifold growth in internet speeds has occasioned the generation of an enormous amount of data, now termed 'big data'. Given this scenario, storage of data on local servers or a personal computer is an issue, which can be resolved by utilizing cloud computing. At present, there are several cloud computing service providers available to resolve the big data issues. This paper establishes a framework that builds Hadoop clusters on the new single-board computer (SBC) Mobile Raspberry Pi. Moreover, these clusters offer facilities for storage as well as computing. Besides the fact that the regular data centers require large amounts of energy for operation, they also need cooling equipment and occupy prime real estate. However, this energy consumption scenario and the physical space constraints can be solved by employing a Mobile Raspberry Pi with Hadoop clusters that provides a cost-effective, low-power, high-speed solution along with micro-data center support for big data. Hadoop provides the required modules for the distributed processing of big data by deploying map-reduce programming approaches. In this work, the performance of SBC clusters and a single computer were compared. It can be observed from the experimental data that the SBC clusters exemplify superior performance to a single computer, by around 20%. Furthermore, the cluster processing speed for large volumes of data can be enhanced by escalating the number of SBC nodes. Data storage is accomplished by using a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which offers more flexibility and greater scalability than a single computer system. © 2018 KIPS.},

	abstract = {This paper shows how a gesture controller can effectively improve the flow of controlling a drone. A simulation is used to demonstrate the gesture controller. This controller uses an MPU6050 sensor which is connected to a nodeMCU microcontroller. The Complementary filter neglects the error by combining the gyroscope and accelerometer values to get accurate values. As soon as the controller is moved in a specific direction the sensor sends a signal to the server. Then the Raspberry Pi which is connected to a wireless network reads the signals by the controller and sends them to simulator. Subsequently, the simulator generates a specific angle and position so that the direction and the speed can be controlled. When using a handheld controller, the user must have some previous knowledge of the device. Normal controllers have an excessive number of configurations, which can be challenging. This form of controller requires appropriate training. A gesture controller, on the other hand, allows you to manipulate a drone by simply moving your hand in a particular direction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Due to a tremendous shortage of trained manpower and a huge cost for setting up state-of-the-art facilities, it is often not possible to deliver proper health care services in the rural and remote areas. Lack of accurate and timely information further adds complexity and challenges to the problem. The proposed system uses a three-tier architecture that can be generally applied to WSN based healthcare systems. The proposed model monitors the patient body temperature, heartbeat, and body position movements constantly, and sends this information to site pages and crisis centres/services from the remote location. WSNs are composed of low power consuming sensors. Raspberry pi is a credit card sized board that uses 5V power supply. The proposed and implemented system prototype uses raspberry pi that is driven by Internet of Things (IoT) connected through different sensors DS18B20, ADXL345, ADC1015 and heartbeat sensor. The framework additionally gives crisis warning to a specialist and sends the information on a web server. The framework utilizes DS18B20, heartbeat sensor, and accelerometer. The system is designed secured by providing a mechanism to authenticate the user to get access to patient data. Implemented system hardware prototype consists of two controllers that provide a mechanism to bring personal health status in the normal range in case of emergency. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Multicore processors have become the standard in modern computing platforms. Such complex hardware enables faster execution of the programs it runs, but this is only true if its programmer has the knowledge and ability to make it so. Thus, there is a great need to prepare computing students by establishing robust educational tools. Existing tools often include abstract learning environments such as a virtual machine. While such platforms are widely available and convenient, they are unable to expose students to concurrency on real hardware.This paper presents multicore Embedded Xinu, an educational operating system used to teach concurrency concepts at the university level.

	abstract = {Current low-cost general-purpose single-board computing (SDC) devices are gaining increasing interests in research computing due to their very low cost/performance ratio and energy consumption. Among all the SDCs available nowadays, Raspberry Pi devices constitute maybe the most renowned representatives. On the other hand, the wavelet transform plays an important role in contemporary standards for image compression (such as JPEG-2000) and video compression (MPEG-4). In this work, we present and evaluate three parallelization strategies of the 3D fast wavelet transform (3D-FWT) on a cluster of Raspberry Pi 2 SDCs. Each parallelization strategy has been implemented using both POSIX Threads (shared memory) and MPI (message passing). The set of implementations using POSIX Threads is restricted to runs on a single board, whereas multiple boards can be used for the MPI versions. We find out that noticeable speed-ups can be obtained when all MPI processes or POSIX Threads are run using the cores of a single Raspberry Pi 2 SDC. However, in the case of the MPI versions, we observe that performance drops drastically when all MPI processes spread to several boards. The reason for this is the limited bandwidth that the onboard LAN port can deliver, and that proves insufficient for the fine-grained, high-volume communication requirements of the studied parallelization strategies. Finally, we have also considered the execution of the POSIX Threads and MPI versions on a very high-performance but power-hungry 4-core Intel Xeon CPU E5606, obtaining that the Raspberry Pi 2 SDC can do the task with much lower total energy consumption (up to 4 times). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Implementation of the wireless-based monitoring system widely implemented in the application of natural disasters, health monitoring, and military operations. One of the health services applications is the monitoring system of heartbeat and body temperature. Examination of the vital sign is a fundamental parameter for medical personnel in performing treatment early to maintain the safety and physical condition of patients. However, the problems that occur in health services is that medical staff need a long time to examine patients, patient data retrieval is still conventional, and equipment used still using the cable media. To solve the problem, the authors propose a heart rate monitoring system and body temperature using Raspberry Pi. This study aims to relieve the burden of medical personnel in monitoring the patient, shorten the time in taking patient data, and reduce the occurrence of misdiagnosis. Test results showed that the success rate of the system in detecting the heartbeat of 97.78% and body temperature of 99.73%.

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as the reference processing architecture for the implementation of multiple computer vision tasks. They achieve much higher accuracy than traditional algorithms based on shallow learning. However, it comes at the cost of a substantial increase of computational resources. This constitutes a challenge for embedded vision systems performing edge inference as opposed to cloud processing. In such a demanding scenario, several open-source frameworks have been developed, e.g. Caffe, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Theano, Torch or MXNet. All of these tools enable the deployment of various state-of-the-art DNN models for inference, though each one relies on particular optimization libraries and techniques resulting in different performance behavior. In this paper, we present a comparative study of some of these frameworks in terms of power consumption, throughput and precision for some of the most popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. The benchmarking system is Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, a low-cost embedded platform with limited resources. We highlight the advantages and limitations associated with the practical use of the analyzed frameworks. Some guidelines are provided for suitable selection of a specific tool according to prescribed application requirements. © 2018 SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.},

The number of times the subject blinks will be taken into account for identification of the subject's drowsiness. Also the direction of where the user is looking will be estimated according to the location of the user's eye gaze. The developed algorithm was implemented on a Raspberry Pi board in order to create a portable system.

This typically requires curve-fitting or optimization procedures to determine the circuit parameters of the selected equivalent circuit model that best fit the collected data. This work describes the performance (in terms of accuracy and execution time) of a nonlinear least squares optimization implementation using SciPy on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) for the analysis of simulated bioimpedance measurements, compared to MATLAB implementations of the same method. The SciPy/RPi implementation yielded similar accuracy to the MATLAB counterparts though the execution time ranged from 1.4 × to 2.1 × longer than the MATLAB environments and 10× greater than the same Python implementation running on a desktop or laptop environment. The performance of this optimization implementation on the RPi does support its suitability for further bioimpedance applications and its further use for applications requiring postprocessing in addition to data collection from connected sensors. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Cryptographic techniques are crucial in ensuring the security of Wireless Sensor Networks data to limit the effect of such offensive operations. As a consequence, many cryptographic techniques are used to assure network security. Cryptography makes use of two techniques: symmetric-key and asymmetric-key cryptography. However, specific concerns remain. In this paper, a hybrid security algorithm is proposed. It provides both high security and fast encryption and decryption processes by using symmetric-key and asymmetric-key techniques. In addition, it provides three cryptographic primitives: confidentiality, authentication, and integrity. The concept is to encrypt using Blowfish, Rivest Cipher 4, and the Advanced Encryption Standard. Message Digest 5 is used for integrity, and Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman is used for authentication. Two computers and a Raspberry Pi test the proposed algorithm's performance. The proposed algorithm exceeds numerous current algorithms in ciphertext size, encryption time, decryption time, and throughput. Using a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and a plaintext size of 184,162 bytes, the proposed algorithm achieved a 37% reduction in ciphertext size, a 90.5% reduction in encryption time, a 62.7% reduction in decryption time, and a 1052% increase in throughput compared to previously published works.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The operation of photovoltaic (PV) module under partial shadow conditions considers a big challenge for most researchers due to power loss and hot spots that reduce the amount of extracted power. In such an operation, the panel voltage–power curve has a unique global maximum power (GMP) to be tracked. Therefore, this paper proposes a new maximum power point tracker (MPPT) implemented by Raspberry Pi 4-based embedded board programmed via two metaheuristic approaches of cuckoo search (CS) and particle swarm optimizer (PSO). The approaches are developed using python software programming language to adapt the duty cycle fed to the MOSFET of DC/DC boost converter connected to the panel terminals. The panel is simulated in Simulink/Matlab library to identify the GMP in each studied case. An experimental setup is conducted in the lab room of the college of Engineering, Jouf University, Saudi Arabia to assess the proposed tracker. Moreover, eight shade patterns are considered via covering 10% to 80% with step 10% of panel with shadow. Furthermore, statistical tests of the Wilcoxson sign rank test and ANOVA are conducted to assess the validity of the proposed tracker. The obtained results are compared to perturb and observe (P&O) and gray​ wolf optimizer (GWO). The PSO-based tracker achieved the best efficiency of 96.92%, the CS achieved 93.62%, and GWO get an efficiency of 93.15%. Additionally, on the side of Wilcoxson sign rank and ANOVA tests, the PSO outperformed CS and GWO. The results confirmed the superiority of the proposed Raspberry Pi system programmed via PSO over that of CS and GWO in enhancing the power generated from the panel operated at different partial shades. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In this paper, Software Defined Network (SDN) technology is applied using the Open Network Operating System (ONOS), which can separate the control plane and the data plane on a network device. ONOS is installed on Raspberry-Pi 3 to minimize the use of Personal Computer (PC) devices on SDN networks. ONOS is also implemented to support Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) features that create the Layer-2 network by using the OpenFlow protocol. Software is connected to the host network by connecting to network overlays that are connected to the OpenFlow data plane protocol. VPLS can maximize the existing bandwidth when communication occurs between remote network devices on a local network. We tested voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) with a variety of background traffic. The test results show that the network performance meets the good level according to the THIPON standard. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Adiabatic temperature rise is an important method for determining isocyanate conversion in polyurethane foam reactions as well as many other exothermic chemical reactions. Adiabatic temperature rise can be used in conjunction with change in height and mass measurements to gain understanding into the blowing and gelling reactions that occur during polyurethane foaming as well as give important information on cell morphology. FoamPi is an open-source Raspberry Pi device for monitoring polyurethane foaming reactions. The device effectively monitors temperature rise, change in foam height as well as changes in the mass during the reaction. Three Python scripts are also presented. The first logs raw data during the reaction. The second corrects temperature data such that it can be used in adiabatic temperature rise reactions for calculating isocyanate conversion; additionally this script reduces noise in all the data and removes erroneous readings. The final script extracts important information from the corrected data such as maximum temperature change and maximum height change as well as the time to reach these points. Commercial examples of such equipment exist however the price (>£10000) of these equipment make these systems inaccessible for many research laboratories. The FoamPi build presented is inexpensive (£350) and test examples are shown here to indicate the reproducibility of results as well as precision of the FoamPi. © 2022 The Authors},

The developed system provides information that can be used for a fast in situ identification and classification of samples based on the analysis of captured images. The connectivity of the instrument allows a deeper analysis of the images in an external computer. Design/methodology/approach The wavelength selection of the system is carried out by light multiplexing through a light-emitting diode panel where eight wavelengths covering the spectrum from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared region (NIR) have been included. The image sensor used is a red green blue - infrared (RGB-IR) micro-camera controlled by a Raspberry Pi board where a basic image processing algorithm has been programmed. It allows the visualization in an integrated display of the reflectance and the histogram of the images at each wavelength, including UV and NIRs. Findings The prototype has been tested by analyzing several samples in a variety of applications such as detection of damaged, over-ripe and sprayed fruit, classification of different type of plastic materials and determination of properties of water. Originality/value The designed system presents some advantages as being non-expensive and portable in comparison to other multispectral imaging systems. The low-cost and size of the camera module connected to the Raspberry Pi provides a compact instrument for general purposes. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Dehazing is still a challenging problem for the outdoor images. The occurrence of haze, fog, mist etc., reduce the visibility of captured images in the outdoor environment. There are several dehazing techniques proposed to resolve the haze in the outdoor images but the existing techniques suffers from the computational time complexity. For a real-time application time complexity plays a major role. As a part of real-time application haze removal is done using the raspberry pi b+v1.2. The hazy image is restored by taking dark channel with patch size of 11 × 11 to avoid the oversaturation of recovered scene radiance and halo effect. Getting the image size and channels, the image is flattened to get the top bright points. Then the image is padded at the ends with a square of side of the window to get the minimum comparision at the ends. Because the atmospheric light to be taken from the foreground as the background has almost same pixel values distributed. The intensity is found, from that maximum among these pixels are found and considered for atmospheric light. The transmission map is found, hazy image is restored. And the performance of modified approach is compared with paper perception oriented haze image restoration based on physical optics model. Hence, to give a better dehazing images with reduced computational time using raspberry pi b+v1.2. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This document describes a new Mathematica package, DiscreteSets.m programmed in PiWolfram. Since the Mathematica license is expensive, a Raspberry Pi computer is used since, thanks to its low cost and a free version of Mathematica that runs on it, it makes the new Mathematica package accessible to a greater number of users. To show the performance of the new package, a full set of illustrative examples is provided. This package admits as input a certain operation between two or three discrete and finite sets, whose elements can be numbers, letters or certain figures. And it returns as output the Venn diagram corresponding to the given operation, with the location of the elements of the sets similar to how they would be located manually. Allowing students to interactively learn and dabble in the PiWolfram programming language. Programming has been the cause of the great advances in technology. For this reason, it is important to incorporate technological education into the learning of Mathematics so that students appreciate the real importance of mathematics today. Through mathematics we can understand the world around us. It is present in various human activities: daily life, social and cultural aspects, in such a way that it is an essential key to understanding and transforming culture.

The main objective of this paper is to develop a non-intrusive real-time drowsiness warning system by monitoring eye state of the driver. The proposed system uses eye-aspect-ratio and is implemented in Raspberry Pi. This system is optimized using three techniques, by re-sizing the frame to be processed, using a single eye for drowsy detection and by not processing every frame. The selection of frames is based on analyzing the redundancy nature of video frames.

The proposed module is divided into two, one is static object detection which uses Threshold value matching, SURF feature extraction for obstacle matching and Bivariate gaussian mixture model for high dimensional bivariate features extracted and later to convert the obtained visual information into the audio information using a raspberry-pi setup. Secondly the system deals with the dynamic obstacles too for which employs Gaussian mixture distribution in modeling background of each pixel and an on-line approximation to update the model. The moving human region is detected by background subtraction. The shadow detection and elimination are implemented in the HSV space, and finally morphological operations are introduced to eliminate noise and reconstruct moving human regions. The results show that the method models stable background, eliminates shadow, and has a good detection result. This algorithm detects the shape of the object and searches from the database provided in the hardware and converts the textual information to an audio information. The audio information is given in-terms of a vibration which protects the eardrum and also helps as a hearing aid for the partial hearing loss people.

	abstract = {As technology is advancing day by day, people are trying to make the most use of it, especially in the field of automation. They want to automate every possible thing from an electronic appliance such as light, fan, heater to monitor their home by providing intrusion detection or surveillance, remotely. They want automated systems over manual systems because automation makes life easier, provides security, and saves time as well as electricity. Here comes the role of Internet of things (IoT) which makes automation possible. This research paper presents a system which is built on Raspberry Pi, acting as the main controller of the system. Pi-Face Relay Plus or Key Studio Board acting as the interface between appliances and the Pi, letting the user automate devices such as LED light through a Python application. The application has buttons to turn on/off the devices. We are also using DHT11 sensors for humidity and temperature. The system has a camera attached for taking images and videos. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

	abstract = {Background: The proposed system describes a surveillance system developed using Raspberry Pi and a camera, which keeps monitoring a certain highly secured region continuously. When the system recognizes a change in motion (human motion) compared to its previous frame, the system starts recording video and stores it primarily in its memory and also in the cloud (for the reason that even if the burglar tries to destroy the system his image/video will be saved in the cloud storage), and the user receives alert mail from the system stating “human motion detected” along with the captured image attached with the alert mail. The system contains database of face patterns of local suspects which is compared with the face pattern of the person triggering the system, and image processing is done in real time to correctly identify the detected face; the system also keeps tracking the face throughout the region even if the person moves out of the frame by a camera mounted over a servo motor. The system turns on a buzzer alarm when the burglar attempts to cause damage to the system. The system allows the user to remotely access the camera to monitor live streaming video output and control the rotation of the camera. Methods/Statistical analysis: In this project, different types of surveillance systems which already exist are analysed, and the methods of having a portable surveillance system were developed using Raspberry Pi. Image processing methods for facial identification and face recognition is used. Findings: A study based on various image processing techniques is done; it is found that Haar-cascade and linear binary pattern are the suitable algorithm for performing image processing in real time. Application/Improvements: For better surveillance, face tracking in introduced, which can track the detected face throughout the region even if the person goes out of the camera frame, and remote accessing with control of the camera through IoT is introduced. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

	abstract = {Security is a major thing to focus on during this modern era as it is very important to secure your surroundings for the well being of oneself and his family, But there are many drawbacks of using conventional security surveillance cameras as they have to be set in a particular angle for good visual and they do not cover a large area, conventional security cameras can only be used from a particular device and cannot alert the user during an unforeseen circumstance. Hence we require a much more efficient device for better security a web controlled surveillance robot is much more practical device to be used compared to conventional security surveillance, this system needs a single camera to perform its operation and the user can monitor a wide range of area, any device with a wireless connection to the internet can be used to operate this device. This robot can move to any location within the range of the network and can be accessed globally from anywhere and as it uses only one camera to secure a large area it is also cost-efficient. At the core of the system lies Raspberry-pi which is responsible for all the operation of the system and the size of the device can be engineered according to the area it is to be used.  © 2021 IEEE.},
