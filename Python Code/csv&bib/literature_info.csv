The method to achieve this was to give them their own, low cost computer that they could use to program on, as a replacement for a family PC that often did not allow this option. With the original release, the Raspberry Pi included two programming environments in the standard distribution software: Scratch and IDLE, a Python environment. In this paper, we describe two programming environments that we developed and recently ported and optimised for the Raspberry Pi, Greenfoot and BlueJ, both using the Java programming language. Greenfoot and BlueJ are both now included in the Raspberry Pi standard software distribution, and they differ in many respects from IDLE; they are more graphical, more interactive, more engaging, and illustrate concepts of object orientation more clearly. Thus, they have the potential to support the original aim of the Raspberry Pi by creating a deeper engagement with programming. This paper describes these two environments and how they may be used, and discusses their differences and relationships to the two previously available systems. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","computer software; java programming language; bluej; educational programming; greenfoot; java; object orientation; programming education; programming environment; standard distributions; computer programming","bluej; greenfoot; java; programming education; raspberry pi","NA","Electronics (Switzerland)","18","0.590","49","383","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","0","1","4","14","76"

Low-cost single-board computers are predicted to be one of the key technological advancements to further revolutionise this field. So far, an overview of current uptake of these devices and a general guide to help researchers integrate them in their work has been missing. In this paper I focus on the most widely used single-board computer, the Raspberry Pi, and review its broad applications and uses across the biological domain. Since its release in 2012, the Raspberry Pi has been increasingly taken up by biologists, in the laboratory, the field and in the classroom, and across a wide range of disciplines. A hugely diverse range of applications exists that ranges from simple solutions to dedicated custom-build devices, including nest-box monitoring, wildlife camera trapping, high-throughput behavioural recording, large-scale plant phenotyping, underwater video surveillance, closed-loop operant learning experiments and autonomous ecosystem monitoring. Despite the breadth of its implementations, the depth of uptake of the Raspberry Pi by the scientific community is still limited. The broad capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, combined with its low cost, ease of use and large user community make it a great research tool for almost any project. To help accelerate the uptake of the Raspberry Pi by the scientific community, I provide detailed guidelines, recommendations and considerations, and 30+ step-by-step guides on a dedicated accompanying website (http://raspberrypi-guide.github.io). I hope this paper will help generate more awareness about the Raspberry Pi among scientists and thereby both fuel the democratisation of science and ultimately help advance our understanding of biology, from the micro- to the macro-scale. © 2021 The Authors.

From several experiments conducted on six recruited subjects, the findings revealed that the accuracy of Haar Cascade classifier to detect the eyes and faces was subjected to correct sitting position (head must facing to the camera) as well as the eyes must not be covered with glasses or shades. Meanwhile, the range of average EAR value detected by the system was between 0.141 (eyes closed) and 0.339 (eyes opened).

To automate a machine, a secondary brain (another machine) is required to 'Think' and control machines to do tasks as per the convenience of the user from long distances. An automation system is proposed for the users to control home electronic appliances with high mobility and security. A set of switches will be controlled by internet with the use of a Raspberry pi micro-controller board. A Raspberry pi micro-controller board obtains user input from a website that is accessed through a user name and password. The customized user friendly website has several buttons to control the appliances. A Raspberry pi will be located in a room and will be connected to all electronic appliances in the home with the help of electromagnetic relays. The Raspberry pi can be controlled from any distant place with the help of weaved cloud service. Webiopi framework gives us a platform to interact with Raspberry pi's General Purpose Input Output pins. The Raspberry pi then either passes or stops current through an electromagnetic relay connected to the intended switch and this closes/opens the circuit allowing the appliance to run or get switched off.

The proposed system is composed of two main subsystems. The first is a Raspberry Pi, to be installed in each class, and the second is a web application fed by data from the Raspberry Pi. To take attendance, an instructor commands a Raspberry Pi camera through a web-based subsystem. Then, the camera takes a picture of the whole class and detects faces using trained Haar Cascades. It sends back a file with the class picture and Cartesian coordinates of the detected faces. The web application parses the file, looking for the coordinates of faces. For each Region of Interest, it uses the Support Vector Machine algorithm to recognize faces based on their HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features. The recognizer uses a pre-built dataset of that particular class containing the students' personal photos, names and ID numbers. Features of each face were extracted using HOG and trained to construct the model over a given class of students. Once every detected face is recognized, the application generates a report for the instructor showing the list of students' names and attendance status. © 2022","NA","haar cascade; histogram of oriented gradients (hog); machine learning; raspberry pi; svm","NA","J.

The risk of security and privacy towards IoT devices, especially smarthomes IoT gateway device, becoming apparent as IoT technology progressed. The need for affordable, secure smarthome gateway device or router that smarthome user prefer. The problem of low-performance smarthome gateways was running security programs on top of smarthome gateway programs. This problem motivates the researcher designing a secure and efficient smarthome gateway using Raspberry Pi hardware as an affordable smarthome gateway device and able to run both smarthome gateways and security programs. In this research, researchers implemented snort as intrusion detection system (IDS), openHab as IoT gateway applications, and well-known encryption algorithms for file encryption in Raspberry PI 3B+ model. The researcher evaluated Snort capability on network attacks and compared each of the well-known encryption algorithm efficiency. From the result, we found Rasefiberry customized snort configuration for Raspberry pi 60 percent of the simulated network attacks.

This system helps the blind man by giving the name of the family member as audio information. Raspberry Pi is a very powerful processor where machine learning can be integrated very easily like SVM, KNN, and Tensor Flow, etc. Blind People can easily identify their native family members by using their voice. When family members stop talking, it's quite impossible to identify the man near the blind man. So, here we introduce a Raspberry pi based system that can easily identify the person in front of the blind man and give audio name information. In this system, we use raspberry pi face recognition, face encoding, and face database creation for family member face recognition. So this device can be a great assistive device for the blind man.

These devices are not only expensive, but are difficult and time-consuming to install. They are simply not affordable and do not provide owners of vessels with a cost effective way of measuring and monitoring their vessels' motion during operation. Measured vessel motion could be used to deduce the sea state using the wave buoy analogy. This additional information could be crucial in improving operational safety for vessels. If motion monitoring is to be used to help improve a vessel's operational stability and provide operational critical information, cheaper and simpler alternatives are needed. In this paper, we present a novel motion measurement system which uses a Raspberry Pi with a wireless module and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor to measure a vessel's motions. The data collected can either be stored locally on the Raspberry Pi or be sent wirelessly to the user. Compared to traditional devices, the Raspberry Pi is cheaper and easier to install. In addition, due to its computing power, some of the post-processing of data, which is traditionally done on a computer separate from the measuring unit, can be done on the Raspberry Pi. For a practical evaluation of using the Raspberry Pi to measure ship motion, it was placed on a fishing vessel for two hours. The IMU used measured nine degrees of freedom, all of which were recorded at 50 Hz on the Raspberry Pi. Afterwards, the data was taken from the Raspberry Pi wirelessly and analysed using Matlab, firstly to ensure that the right data was collected at the right frequency, and secondly to visualise the data. The evaluation shows that using the Raspberry Pi, as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, is a light-weight, cost-effective, and easy-to-install alternative to traditional devices for measuring vessel motion. © 2015 IEEE.","cost effectiveness; data handling; degrees of freedom (mechanics); fishing vessels; internet; matlab; ocean currents; sensors; ships; units of measurement; waves; computing power; inertial measurement unit; internet of things (iot); motion measurements; operational safety; operational stability; ship motion; traditional devices; internet of things","iot; raspberry pi; sensor; ship motion; waves","NA","IEEE World Forum Internet Things, WF-IoT - Proc.","9","NA","NA","77","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","0","1","0","9","34"

First, a Raspberry Pi heterogeneous MPICH cluster with weight-based load balancing and fuzzy estimation of node computational performance was designed. Fuzzification, formation of fuzzy rules, fuzzy inference, and defuzzification were employed to determine the performance weights. In the cluster with two Raspberry Pi 4B boards with 2 GB RAM and Raspberry Pi 64-bit OS and one Raspberry Pi 3B board with 1 GB RAM and Raspberry Pi 32-bit OS, the recommended performance weights are (5, 5, 1), respectively. The developed Python program for the prime numbers finding algorithm employs the proposed weight-based load balancing, which is approximately five times faster than the basic algorithm with equal loading for the maximum integer of 300000. Second, the MPICH cluster with two nodes in two virtual machines located on two different Raspberry Pi 4B boards with Ubuntu Server for ARM on the hypervisor VMware ESXi ARM Fling shows the mean signed deviation −34.01 s regarding the Raspberry Pi 64-bit OS for the maximum integer of 300000. Third, the performance of the Raspberry Pi 4B 8 GB computer with Windows 11 ARM OS was compared with the laptop Lenovo G510 with Intel Core i7-4700MQ and Windows 10 64-bit OS using the combinatorial optimization algorithm implemented in the 32-bit Windows app. The Raspberry Pi 4B 8 GB consumed approximately six times more power. Thus, the Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer is recommended for executing low-performance applications and/or short-term processing of high-performance tasks. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","arm processors; balancing; combinatorial optimization; fuzzy inference; linux; case-studies; fuzzy estimation; load-balancing; mpich cluster; performance; performances evaluation; raspberry pi; ubuntu server; vmware esxi arm fling; window 11 arm; windows operating system","mpich cluster; raspberry pi; ubuntu server; vmware esxi arm fling; windows 11 arm","NA","Commun.

Working age members have to work outside in the day time to get enough income for the family. Elderly are forced to live alone and facing a difficulty because they cannot see things clearly. In this research, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for household objects finder and localizer is proposed. Raspberry Pi 3 is used to create a wearable device for elderly to help see objects and tell the type and location of the objects via voice. YOLO neuron network is selected because of the speed and resource consumption. Data set of household objects images was prepared and fed into YOLO network as training inputs. Training process is done on a desktop computer before transferred into Raspberry Pi 3. Trained YOLO can classify and local several objects in the same time with accuracy of 83%. By using PeachPy and NEON instruction set for compiling YOLO in ARM environment, the speed of detection and localization in Raspberry Pi 3 equals to 0.8 seconds per image. Prototype of wearable device is built by using a camera, headphone, push switch, battery and Raspberry Pi 3.

Specifically, it investigates the performance difference between a 2-node Pi 4B Spark cluster and other systems, including a single Pi 4B and a mid-end desktop computer. Enhancements for the Pi 4B were studied and compared against the Spark cluster to identify the more effective method in increasing the Pi 4B’s DL performance. Three experiments involving DL inference, which in turn involve image classification and face detection tasks, were carried out. Results showed that enhancing the Pi 4B was faster than using a cluster as there was no significant performance difference between using the cluster and a single Pi 4B. The difference between the mid-end computer and a single Pi 4B was between 6 and 15 times in the experiments. In the meantime, enhancing the Pi 4B is the more effective approach for increasing the DL performance, and more work needs to be done for scalable distributed DL inference to eventuate. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; learning systems; cluster; deep learning; faces detection; inference; learning performance; machine learning; machine-learning; performance; raspberry pi (pi); tensorflow; face recognition","cluster; deep learning (dl); inference; machine learning (ml); model; raspberry pi (pi); spark; tensorflow","NA","Future Internet","2","0.793","38","NA","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","1","1","0","2","37"

These controlled conditions also reduce the applicability of the obtained results to more varied environments and may limit their relevance to everyday situations. New method Advances in computer portability may increase the mobility and applicability of EEG results while decreasing costs. In this experiment we show that stimulus presentation using a Raspberry Pi 2 computer provides a low cost, reliable alternative to a traditional desktop PC in the administration of EEG experimental tasks. Results Significant and reliable MMN and P3 activity, typical event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with an auditory oddball paradigm, were measured while experiments were administered using the Raspberry Pi 2. While latency differences in ERP triggering were observed between systems, these differences reduced power only marginally, likely due to the reduced processing power of the Raspberry Pi 2. Comparison with existing method An auditory oddball task administered using the Raspberry Pi 2 produced similar ERPs to those derived from a desktop PC in a laboratory setting. Despite temporal differences and slight increases in trials needed for similar statistical power, the Raspberry Pi 2 can be used to design and present auditory experiments comparable to a PC. Results Our results show that the Raspberry Pi 2 is a low cost alternative to the desktop PC when administering EEG experiments and, due to its small size and low power consumption, will enable mobile EEG experiments unconstrained by a traditional laboratory setting. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","acoustic stimulation; adolescent; auditory perception; brain; cell phone; electroencephalography; evoked potentials; female; humans; male; reaction time; young adult; adult; article; computer; electroencephalography; event related potential; female; human; laboratory; latent period; male; noise; priority journal; raspberry; raspberry pi 2; adolescent; auditory stimulation; brain; evoked response; hearing; mobile phone; physiology; reaction time; young adult","ecological; eeg; erp; hardware; portable; raspberry pi; software","27894782","J.

Sutami Street 36A, Jawa Tengah, Surakarta, Indonesia","Despite the growing popularity of network operating system courses in vocational high schools, issues have been raised regarding the lack of appropriate computer hardware specifications and the limited use of real networking devices. The media that have been used in teaching network operating systems have been based on virtualization-based simulation. However, such virtualization does not expose students to real hardware. This results in less than optimal hands-on activities and students' psychomotor abilities. Consequently, alternative authentic media are needed to accommodate practical learning and improve psychomotor skills. The aim of this study is to explore the implementation of a single-board microcomputer in learning network operating systems. The Raspberry Pi was chosen as it can replace the role of a non-simulation PC. The choice of Raspberry Pi was also based on the fact that in Indonesia it is still rare to find its implementation for teaching and learning activities in vocational high school, so it is necessary to introduce the device to students. The operating system used by the Raspberry Pi is similar to Ubuntu, which is one of the network operating systems that must be mastered by vocational IT students. The research made a comparison between the two learning media as employed by two groups of students in different classes, one using virtualization-based simulation and the other using the Raspberry Pi. Based on the results, it is concluded that the use of the Raspberry Pi is more effective than that of virtualization-based simulation in improving students' psychomotor and troubleshooting skills.  © 2021 Puspanda Hatta and Cucuk Wawan Budiyanto, published by De Gruyter 2021.","NA","network operating system; raspberry pi; simulation; vocational high school","NA","Open Eng.","0","0.209","28","1201+","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","0","1","0","0","74"

Traditional methods have their own drawbacks. Hence, a newborn personal authentication system is proposed for this issue based on bimodal biometric system wherein footprint of newborn and finger print of their mother is used for recognition. This concept is further enhanced by developing a prototype to be implemented on a raspberry Pi (a single board computer). In this paper, SIFT feature extraction, RANSAC algorithm for matching of fingerprint and footprint biometrics using OpenCV on Raspberry pi is implemented. The raspberry Pi is ARM1176JZFS application processor, System on chip (SoC) denoted as Broadcom BCM2835. It enhances performance, consumes less power, and reduces overall system cost and size. The raspberry Pi is been controlled by a modified version of Debian Linux optimized for ARM architecture. The image recognition is performed using open source OpenCV-2.4.9 in Linux platform using CMake, g++, makefile. Thereby the proposed system improves the security system in hospitals/birth centers and provides a low cost solution to the newborn swapping rather than the expensive DNA procedures.

Many commercial options for wildlife observation are expensive, obtrusive, or sub-optimal in remote environments. In this paper, we explore the viability of a Raspberry Pi-based camera system augmented with a deep learning image recognition model for detecting wildlife of interest. Unlike traditional sensor nodes that would have to transmit every captured image, localized image recognition enables only pictures of desired animals to be transferred to the user. For the purposes of this study, we use TensorFlow and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. We trained the model on nearly 3,600 images gathered from publicly available image databases that are split into three classes. Our experiments suggest that our system can detect snow leopards with between 74 percent and 97 percent accuracy. We believe that our results show the viability of employing deep learning image recognition models on the Raspberry Pi to create an inexpensive system to observe wildlife. © 2019 IEEE.","animals; convolution; convolutional neural networks; deep neural networks; image classification; image recognition; learning systems; mobile telecommunication systems; sensor nodes; ubiquitous computing; camera systems; image database; image-recognition model; keras; remote environment; single board computers; snow leopard; tensorflow; deep learning","convolutional neural network; deep learning; keras; raspberry pi; single board computer; tensorflow","NA","IEEE Annu.

The glycosylation of this compound is a potential approach used to improve its pharmaceutical properties. In this work, raspberry ketone glycosides are produced in bacteria for the first time. Bacillus licheniformis PI15, an organic solvent-tolerant glycosyltransferase-producing strain, was isolated from chemically polluted soil. The cloning and heterologous expression of a glycosyltransferase, which was designated PI-GT1, in Escherichia coli BL21 resulted in the expression of an active and soluble protein that accounted for 15% of the total cell protein content. Purified PI-GT1 was highly active and stable over a broad pH range (6.0–10.0) and showed excellent pH stability. PI-GT1 maintained almost 60% of its maximal activity after 3 H of incubation at 20–40 °C and demonstrated optimal activity at 30 °C. Additionally, PI-GT1 displayed high stability and activity in the presence of hydrophilic solvents with log P ≤ −0.2 and retained more than 80% of its activity after 3 H of treatment. Supplementation with 10% DMSO markedly improved the glycosylation of raspberry ketone, resulting in a value 26 times higher than that in aqueous solution.

Raspberry Pi is a small and low-cost computing device with features that suggest its application as embedded control hardware in mobile robots, aiming the implementation of computer vision and motion control, for example. However, the default operating system of the Raspberry Pi limits its performance in real time. In order to enable it to work in real time, the RT-Preempt patch was installed, which incorporates features of a real-time operating system into Linux. Installing the RT-Preempt patch generates changes to the Linux kernel that reduce its limitations and consequently improve the system's temporal performance. Several system performance tests were performed, measuring the latencies obtained in different situations, such as: polling, timed loop, hardware interrupt and software interrupt. The experimental results confirm a significant improvement in the temporal performance of the system and show the limitations found regarding the use of the Raspberry Pi with the RT-Preempt patch in real-time applications. Based on these results, it can be concluded that it can be used as a low cost solution in non-critical real-time applications. © 2019 IEEE.","computer hardware; cost benefit analysis; costs; embedded systems; interactive computer systems; linux; robotics; software testing; visual servoing; embedded real time systems; performance analysis; real time; real time operating system; real time performance; real-time application; real-time linux; rt preempt patch; real time systems","embedded real time systems; raspberry pi in real time; real time linux; rt preempt patch","NA","Proc. - Lat.

In this work, we first discuss the idea of the genome, its importance and wide-ranging applications in healthcare and medicine. We then give a brief overview of the various file formats used presently to store and manipulate genomic data along with their benefits and shortcomings. Moving on, we analyze and elaborate on how parallel and distributed computing can help in processing large files with genomic data and more importantly address the problem of pattern matching. In particular, we introduce the raspberry-pi and discuss in detail how a Raspberry Pi can accomplish the pattern matching task and how a Raspberry-Pi cluster can enable parallel computing to improvise the performance. This work also includes a brief account of various high-level application programming interfaces and libraries that can be used to parse genomic data like BioPython and Fuzzywuzzy. We conclude this work by summarizing some techniques that can be used for encoding and compressing files with genomic data like Run-Length encoding and genome differential compression respectively among other methods. The proposed work improvises the Genome pattern matching time by more than 50% in a distributed Raspberry Pi Computing environment. This system is useful to detect a particular genome-based abnormality where different pieces of Genome records are present on the different nodes in distributed computing and the input is given to find the disease. It can detect the abnormality within a short time. Also the different approach used here is to use Raspberry Pi based clustering to save cost and the energy. © 2020 The Authors.

For this reason we analyze the Zodiac FX and Raspberry PI, low cost SDN devices. The main objective will be to find out how well they can perform in small or medium scale networks. In order to accomplish our goal a simple network was used, in which either of the devices was connected to the controller and two hosts. The controller used was Ryu, running under an Ubuntu machine. For the measurement of statistics command line tools from both Ubuntu and OpenFlow were used. One special motivation for the development of this paper is the fact that these devices have not been analyzed in terms of performance. Through the development of this paper we show that the Raspberry PI can be used adequately as a SDN switch. Neither the Zodiac FX nor the Raspberry PI can reach the capacity that the vendors published. And interestingly in terms of bandwidth the Raspberry PI can under certain circumstances have better results than a non SDN conventional CISCO Catalyst switch. © 2019 IEEE.","linux; command line; low costs; medium-scale; network policy; openflow; simple networks; costs","denial of service (dos); network operating system (nos); software defined networks (sdn); testbed","NA","Proc. - Jornadas Costarric.

This system is completely supported voice-based, and it employs a Raspberry Pi circuit. It also has an IR sensor, a voice app, a Bluetooth module, jars for holding water, pipes, and a motor. During this project, the voice app detects the person's speech and transmits the appropriate information to the Raspberry Pi 3, which determines whether the water requested by the person should be hot or cold. The raspberry pi uses the information from the IR sensor to determine whether or not the glass is put beneath the pipe. The device employs infrared sensors to detect the presence of a water glass, after which the IR sensor sends a signal to the Raspberry Pi, causing the motor to start and water to flow via the pipes from the real jar (hot/cold). If the glass is not placed, the sensor sends a signal to the motor, which prevents water from flowing through the pipe until the glass is placed.

However, the initial costs of a telecytology system can be high. We present several low-cost alternatives along with their performance characteristics. Materials and methods: We tested 3 low-cost telecytology systems: a Raspberry Pi with a webcam, an iPhone 4S with FaceTime, and an iPhone 4S with a live streaming app. Costs, resolution capacities, and latency periods for image transmission were determined. Results: At $85.55, the Raspberry Pi system is the least expensive telecytology solution described to date. When the cost per megapixel of resolution is considered, the cost of a Raspberry Pi system is 120× less than the most expensive commercially available option and about 7-fold less than the iPhone-based alternatives. Latency periods were substantially lower for the iPhone systems: 2.5 ± 1 seconds for FaceTime and 2.8 ± 0.3 seconds for iPhone live streaming versus 6.6 ± 0.6 seconds for the Raspberry Pi system at comparable frame rates. Conclusions: This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that inexpensive telecytology systems are able to stream live video feeds of cytology slides from a microscope to a remote location at useable resolutions. © 2014 American Society of Cytopathology.","article; camera; computer program; controlled study; cost; cytology; mobile phone; optical resolution; priority journal; telecytology; telemedicine","fine-needle aspiration; on-site evaluation of adequacy; rapid on-site evaluation; telecytology; telecytopathology; telemicroscopy","NA","J.

Then, one of COVID-19 early detection can be done through wearing a face mask and detecting body temperature when entering a room. The purpose of this research is to create an attendance system capable to recognize face, face mask, and measure body temperature. The data was tested against three types of Raspberry Pi (Pi 3B, Pi 4-4Gb, and Pi 4-8Gb). Each type of Raspberry Pi was tested using three metric combinations of different encoding methods and object classification, namely Method 1 - Haar Cascade and LBPH, Method 2 - Haar Cascade, and Tensorflow, Method 3 - MTCNN and Tensorflow. The test results obtained Method 1: FPS 15, accuracy rate 60%, CPU temperature 58°C, Method 2: FPS 4, accuracy rate 90%, CPU temperature 65°C, Method 3: FPS 2, accuracy rate 95%, CPU temperature 68°C.

This paper presents a real-time human detection scheme on a Raspberry Pi. An efficient algorithm for human detection is proposed by processing regions of interest (ROI) based upon foreground estimation. Different number of scales have been considered for computing Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features for the selected ROI. Support vector machine (SVM) is employed for classification of HOG feature vectors into detected and non-detected human regions. Detected human regions are further filtered by analyzing the area of overlapping regions. Considering the limited capabilities of Raspberry Pi, the proposed scheme is evaluated using six different testing schemes on Town Centre and CAVIAR datasets. Out of these six testing schemes, Single Window with two Scales (SW2S) processes 3 frames per second with acceptable less accuracy than the original HOG. The proposed algorithm is about 8 times faster than the original multi-scale HOG and recommended to be used for real-time human detection on a Raspberry Pi. © 2016 IEEE.","graphic methods; caviar dataset; feature vectors; frames per seconds; histogram of oriented gradients (hog); human detection; overlapping regions; regions of interest; town centre; support vector machines","caviar dataset; histogram of oriented gradients (hog); human detection; raspberry pi; support vector machine; town centre dataset","NA","Int.

Then we modified the algorithm of computation of time frequency-correlation function to be applicable in real-time and implemented it as a C++ object. To increase the performance, we implemented GPU acceleration using GPU_FFT and Vulkan FFT libraries. The first library is a firmware that utilizes VideoCore IV on Raspberry Pi 3B+. Vulkan FFT library was implemented as an alternative compatible with VideoCore VI on Raspberry 4B. To estimate the efficiency of applying the graphical cores to we conducted a set of experiments. Those experiments were designed to measure the reduction in processing time after accelerating the most time computationally operation of inverse Fourier transform with the GPU.

In this study, we made use of the compact “Raspberry Pi” computer to develop an animal damage countermeasure. We also attempted to make the automatic photographing apparatus for dark environments. This device included a Raspberry Pi, infrared camera module, MOSFET, infrared LED floodlight, and pyroelectric infrared ray sensor. The operation of the apparatus is as follows: When the pyroelectric infrared sensor is triggered by the presence of an animal and the signal becomes HIGH, a signal of HIGH is output from GPIO of the Raspberry Pi and a voltage of 12 V is applied to the MOSFET to make it function as a relay circuit. The infrared LED projector then lights up. At the same time the device starts taking a still image or video using the infrared camera that is connected to the Raspberry Pi. The apparatus succeeded in shooting a movie of a rat, and it successfully took still pictures. We installed the machine-learning library “TensorFlow” on the Raspberry Pi and performed image recognition of murine images using a deep learning program. When the target animal occupies a small part of the image, the image recognition results tend to be erroneous; however, enlarging the area of interest results in more accurate detection. In addition, erroneous judgment was often made in infrared camera images. The time required for the determination was 15 to 45 seconds for the Pi 3 Model B. These results show that it is possible to create a low-cost pest countermeasure device or robot controlled by a Raspberry Pi, and capable of various responses and input processing. © 2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

First, we show the performance of random linear network coding primitives on the Raspberry Pi in terms of processing speed and energy consumption under a variety of configuration setups. Our measurements show that processing rates of up to 230 Mbps are possible with the Raspberry Pi. Also, the energy consumption per bit can be as small as 3 nJ/bit, which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the transmission/reception energy use. Surprisingly, overclocking the Raspberry Pi from 700 MHz to 1000 MHz not only produces an increase in processing speed of up to 68 % for large generation sizes, but also provides a reduction of 64 % in the processing energy per bit for most tested scenarios. Then, we show Raspberry Pi as an inexpensive, viable, and flexible platform to deploy large research networking testbeds for the evaluation of network coding protocols.

In this kind of image, it is necessary to describe skin color accurately hence we go on to restore the image based on this criterion. Histogram equalization (HE) is a popular technique for contrast enhancement of images. In order to vary the enhancement degree to get proper skin color, HE with variable enhancement degree (HE-VED) is introduced. The enhancement degree of HE-VED is controlled by intensity and saturation parameter α and β respectively. Dark and low contrast images were captured using the Raspberry Pi camera module and HE-VED was applied to enhance the objective image in a particular enhancement degree automatically with help of Raspberry Pi. Lastly HE-VED was extended to a complete image and appreciable results were obtained which could be further enhanced using different pseudo coloring techniques. © 2014 IEEE.","color; equalizers; graphic methods; image reconstruction; restoration; histogram equalizations; hsi color space; image library; raspbian wheezy; skin color; image enhancement","histogram equalization; hsi color space; python image library; raspberry pi; raspbian wheezy; skin color","NA","Int.

The Raspberry Pi has often been referred as a computer designed to change the world since it is capable to do most things that a desktop computer can do. The growing concern is that all these computers utilize power in order to operate thereby turning ICT into a power drainer. The diverse functionalities present in modern computers including communication and web browsing, among others, were found to be important components that affect the power consumption of such devices. As such, this paper investigates how power consumption of the Raspberry Pi is affected by the key functionalities that could be performed by end-users on the platform.

However, commercial platforms that make consistent image acquisition easy are often cost-prohibitive. To make high-throughput phenotyping methods more accessible, low-cost microcomputers and cameras can be used to acquire plant image data. Methods and Results: We used low-cost Raspberry Pi computers and cameras to manage and capture plant image data. Detailed here are three different applications of Raspberry Pi–controlled imaging platforms for seed and shoot imaging. Images obtained from each platform were suitable for extracting quantifiable plant traits (e.g., shape, area, height, color) en masse using open-source image processing software such as PlantCV. Conclusions: This protocol describes three low-cost platforms for image acquisition that are useful for quantifying plant diversity.

However, the current face recognition technology can identify the identity of the face image but cannot accurately distinguish the authenticity of the input face on embedded devices. Recently, face recognition with face presentation attack detection has become a research hotspot. In this paper, we develop an intelligent face recognition system on Raspberry Pi to handle this issue. Specifically, we first add a face presentation attack detection process to form a three-stage face recognition method to realize face recognition with face anti-spoofing. Second, we select a face detection model, a face presentation attack detection model and a face recognition model suitable for Raspberry Pi, and transplant these models previously trained in the Python environment to the C++ environment. Then we integrate and deploy these three models on Raspberry Pi and use the NCNN inference framework for efficient reasoning within limited memory and computing resources.

Single Board Computers (SBCs) are attracting considerable attention from academics, hobbyists and the industry, due to their compact size, low cost, low power, portability and fair processing ability. Raspberry Pi series SBCs are the pioneer in the field, having Pi, Pi2, Pi3 and Pi Zero in production, supporting different processing and storage capabilities. An IP PBX embedded on the raspberry Pi SBC can serve an adequate number of users and provide a tiny platform that can fit in a pocket and be transported anywhere while preserving the functionality of a complete IP PBX. Such systems can be phenomenally successful in situations where large infrastructures cannot be taken, for instance, in warzones or disaster-affected areas where communication networks are damaged, necessitating an immediate requirement for an ad hoc-based communication system. In this paper, we aim to explore the performance of an Asterisk®-based IP PBX installed on a Raspberry Pi 3 (model B) platform in terms of concurrent call handling using different codecs. © 2022 by the authors.","NA","ad hoc ip pbx; asterisk pbx; ip pbx; raspberry pi 3","NA","Electronics (Switzerland)","0","0.590","49","358","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","0","1","0","0","49"

This paper proposes a very low-cost multiband sensor developed on a Raspberry device and two Raspberry Pi 3 cameras that can be used in photogrammetry from drone applications. The UAV-integrated radiometric sensor and its performance were tested in in two villages of South-west Niger for the detection of temporary surface water bodies (or Ephemeral water bodies): zones of seasonal stagnant water within villages threatening the viability and people's health. The Raspberry Pi 3 cameras employed were a regular RGB Pi camera 2 (Red, Green, Blue) and a NoIR Pi 3 camera v2 (regular RGB without IR filter) with 8MPX resolution. The cameras were geometrically calibrated and radiometrically tested before the survey in the field. The results of the photogrammetry elaborations were 4 orthophotos (a RGB and NoIRGB orthophoto for each village). The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was calculated. The index allowed the localization and the contouring of the temporary surface water bodies present in the villages. The data were checked against the data collected with a Sony (ILCE-5100). Very high correspondence between the different data was detected.

A Raspberry Pi platform impedance sensor node is designed to measure signals at a low-frequency range of up to 100 kHz. The low-frequency impedance measurement via the proposed node has been combined with a new PZT interface technique for measuring local responses sensitive to structural damage. The new PZT interface can work as a surface-mounted or embedded sensor, and its local dynamic characteristics are numerically analyzed to pre-determine an effective impedance resonant frequency range of less than 100 kHz. Next, a software scheme was designed to visualize the input/output parameters of the proposed SSeL-Pi system (i.e., Raspberry Pi platform and PZT interface) and automate signal acquisition procedures of the impedance sensor node. The calibration for impedance signals obtained from the proposed system was performed by a series of procedures, from acquiring real and imaginary impedance to adjusting them with respect to a commercial impedance analyzer (HIOKI-3532). The feasibility of the wireless impedance monitoring system was experimentally evaluated for PZT interfaces that were subjected to various compressive loadings. The consistent results analyzed from signals measured by the SSeL-Pi and HIOKI 3532 systems were observed.

To make the study cheaper and more portable, the Stanford SOLAR Center first presented with a Space Weather Monitoring program called the sudden ionospheric monitors (SID). This monitoring system was used to monitor the Earth's ionosphere changes, which affected the very low frequency (VLF) radio propagations. This low cost but sensitive detection system is used all around the globe via various modifications. This paper presents the monitoring system's design and implementation using Raspberry Pi for a smaller and compact base with less power usage and higher sensitivity.

Unfortunately, misfits will always find new ways to misuse technology to facilitate their misdeeds. CCTV are great security measures that can be used to catch culprits in action, but other than banks, hospitals, shopping malls, academic institutes etc., a CCTV solution is beyond most household budgets and require continuous monitoring. Because mobile phones are the primary hand-held device, it is only logical to integrate these with a CCTV solution. Motion Detection Security System Notifier using Raspberry Pi with Telegram is as the name suggests. Using Raspberry Pi, a motion detection system is developed through the method of background subtraction, which works by subtracting the static from the background frame from the constantly changing foreground. The change of value in noise and pixel density between the background frame and the foreground indicates motion. Each time a motion is detected, the system will automatically send the frame to the user via Telegram to notify that there has been movement in the area as captured in the frames. A prototype is first developed in a virtual environment using VirtualBox software before running it on the Raspberry Pi.

In the conventional irrigation techniques, farmer has to go to the field regularly for checking the condition of the crops and for watering it. With the improvements in digital and communication technologies, automatic irrigation systems have come into existence. In this paper, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based Automatic Irrigation and Security System using Raspberry Pi is implemented. In the proposed system, Raspberry Pi is used as a Coordinator node (CR node), Arduino as End node device, and nRF24L01 transceiver is used for wireless communication and data transfer between the CR node and end node. Each Arduino node collects the various sensor inputs such as soil moisture, temperature, PIR sensor status sends them wirelessly to Raspberry Pi. Based on the sensor parameters and soil status, the water pump is turned on and the various sensor node values are posted on the webpage using Raspberry Pi web server. Farmer can monitor the status of the field on the webpage. Also, there is an option to turn ON/OFF the water pump manually from the webpage. The PIR sensor and a buzzer are used to protect the crop from the cattle entering the field. The system can reduce the water consumption and wastage of water to the crop.

Nonetheless, there are challenges to be implemented in other settings, e.g., mine detection, agriculture support, and tasks for industry 4.0.

A prototype of a robot assembled using mechanical parts of a LEGO MINDSTORMS Robotic Kit EV3 and a Raspberry Pi controlled through servo algorithms of 2D and 2D1/2 vision approaches was implemented to tackle this challenge. This design is supported by simulations based on image, position, and a hybrid scheme for visual servo controllers. Practical implementation is operated using navigation guided by running up image-based visual servo control algorithms embedded in a Raspberry Pi that uses a control criterion based on error evolution to compute the difference between a target and sensed image. Images are collected by a camera installed on a mobile robotic platform manually and automatically operated and controlled using the Raspberry Pi. An Android application to watch the images by video streaming is shown here, using a smartphone and a video related to the implemented robot’s operation.

Many OEE monitoring modules are on the market. These modules are still very expensive so most companies are still unable to implement OEE into production machines. In this research, a software called OEEMAX which functions for OEE monitoring has been developed to be installed on Raspberry Pi. OEEMAX was built to be able to run on Raspberry and be able to read inputs from sensors. OEEMAX is also able to communicate with all types of Programmable Logic Control (PLC). The advantage of Raspberry Pi is the price of the module which is very cheap and uses open source operating system. OEEMAX has been successfully developed and applied to Raspberry Pi.

The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to analyze the performance of different compact CNNs on Raspberry Pi 4; 2) to manually adapted the most promising models to better utilize the Raspberry Pi 4 hardware. After exploring a number of modifications, we present a new CNN architecture, namely MobileNetV3-Small-Pi, which is 36% faster and slightly more accurate on ImageNet classification compared to the baseline MobileNetV3-Small. © 2021 The Authors.

Traditional methods like birth ID bracelets and offline footprint recognition systems have their own drawbacks. Hence, a neonatalonline personal authentication system is proposed for this issue based on multimodal biometric system wherein footprint and palm print of neonatal is used for recognition. This concept is further enhanced by developing a prototype to be implemented on a Raspberry Pi 2 (a single board computer). In this paper, SIFT feature extraction, RANSAC algorithm for identification of matched interest points of palm print and footprint biometrics using OpenCV on Raspberry pi is implemented. The Raspberry Pi is a quad core ARM Cortex A7 application processor, System on chip (SoC) denoted as Broadcom BCM2836. It enhances performance, consumes less power, and reduces overall system cost and size. The Raspberry Pi is been controlled by a modified version of Debian Linux OS optimized for ARM architecture. The image recognition is performed using open source OpenCV-3.1.0 in Linux platform using CMake, g++, makefile. Thereby the proposed system improves the security system in hospitals / birth centers and provides a low cost solution to the newborn swapping rather than the expensive DNA and HLA(Human Leukocyte Antigen)typing procedures.The efficiency(97.2%) is high when multimodality is used than unimodality.

Because of the high complexity and costs of cloud environments, however, newly developed resource allocation strategies are often only validated by means of simulations, for example, by using CloudSim or custom-developed simulation tools. This article describes a general approach for the validation of cloud resource allocation strategies, illustrating the importance of experimental validation on physical testbeds. Furthermore, the design and implementation of Raspberry Pi as a Service (RPiaaS), a low-cost embedded testbed built using Raspberry Pi nodes, is presented. RPiaaS aims to facilitate the step from simulations toward experimental evaluations on larger cloud testbeds and is designed using a microservice architecture, where experiments and all required management services are running inside containers. The performance of the RPiaaS testbed is evaluated using several benchmark experiments. The obtained results not only illustrate that the overhead of both using containers and running the required RPiaaS services is minimal but also provide useful insights for scaling up experiments between the Raspberry Pi testbed and a larger more traditional cloud testbed. The introduced validation approach is then illustrated using a case study focusing on the allocation of hierarchically structured tenant data. The results obtained through simulations are compared to the experimental results. The RPiaaS testbed proved to be a very useful tool for the initial experimental validation before moving the experiments to a large-scale testbed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","benchmarking; cloud computing; containers; cost reduction; natural resources management; resource allocation; benchmark experiments; cloud resource allocations; design and implementations; experimental evaluation; experimental validations; raspberry pi; resource allocation strategies; simulations; testbeds","cloud computing; experimental validation; raspberry pi testbed; resource allocation; simulations","NA","Software Pract Exper","4","0.774","71","141","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","1","1","0","4","111"

In many cases, however, playback experiments are constrained by observer limitations such as the time observers can be present, or the accuracy of observation. These problems are particularly apparent when playbacks are triggered by specific events, such as performing a specific behavior, or are targeted to specific individuals. We developed a low-cost automated playback/recording system, using two field-deployable devices: radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and Raspberry Pi micro-computers. This system detects a specific passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag attached to an individual, and subsequently plays back the stimuli, or records audio or visual information. To demonstrate the utility of this system and to test one of its possible applications, we tagged female and male tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) from two box-nesting populations with PIT tags and carried out playbacks of nestling begging calls every time focal females entered the nestbox over a six-hour period. We show that the RFID-Raspberry Pi systempresents a versatile, low-cost, field-deployable system that can be adapted for many audio and visual playback purposes. In addition, the set-up does not require programming knowledge, and it easily customized to many other applications, depending on the research questions.

The proposed system is able to detect and classify nine common valvular heart cases encompassing eight types of heart valve diseases as well as the normal case of valves. The design and development of the proposed system are mainly divided into two phases, namely development of a disease classification approach, and design and implementation of the diagnostic hardware system. The developed disease classification approach is comprised of five stages, namely obtaining phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, preprocessing, segmentation using a proposed automatic algorithm, feature extraction in three domains (time, frequency, and wavelet decomposition domains) and classification using a backpropagation neural network. The hardware of the diagnostic system consists of a PCG signal acquisition module connected to a processing and displaying unit, which is represented by a Raspberry Pi connected to a touch screen. Where the developed disease classification approach is implemented in the software of the Raspberry Pi to enable it to detect the diseases in real time and fully automatically.

The practical application of SDR in building a spectrum analyser can be complex and expensive; however, the use of lightweight, cost-effective, low-cost SDR and lowpower microprocessors can significantly reduce the cost. This paper investigates ways to build lightweight, cost-effective spectrum analysers and their most effective design and implementation, utilising the RTL-SDR USB device, a software modelling tool (GNU Radio), and a low-power-microprocessor Raspberry Pi. The RTL-SDR USB device, GNU Radio Software and Raspberry Pi are configured together to produce a lightweight SDR-based spectrum analyser. In this particular implementation, the spectrum analyser is used to examine a small section of the electromagnetic spectrum to test the suitability of the configuration for complex Fast Fourier Transform calculations. For comparison purposes, another spectrum analyser is built using a more powerful microprocessor (AMD Turion), and the results recorded and compared. The experimental results and comparative evaluation of the two spectrum analysers demonstrate that the Raspberry Pi-based design performs equally well despite its limited resources and low cost. This shows the success and potential of this SDR and Raspberry Pi-based spectrum analyser as a credible device for a number of intelligence analyses applications in a secure environment. © 2017 IEEE.","analog circuits; cost effectiveness; costs; fast fourier transforms; integrated circuit design; open source software; petroleum reservoir evaluation; radio; radio receivers; spectrum analyzers; comparative evaluations; electromagnetic spectra; intelligence analysis; low power microprocessors; raspberry pi; rtl-sdr; software defined radio (sdr); software-defined radios; software radio","fft; gnu; raspberry pi; rtl-sdr; software defined radio; spectrum analyser","NA","Proc. - UKSim-AMSS European Model.

The turnover time of corresponding light is already fixed in the traffic system and it is not based on the number of vehicle on the particular direction. In our idea, we proposed the enhancement of traffic system controller in a road junction using microcontroller.

However, alongside this expansion is a growing concern that dependable low-cost counter measures do not exist. To mitigate a threat in a restricted airspace, it must first be known that a threat is present. With airport disruption from malicious UASs occurring regularly, low-cost methods for early warning are essential. This paper considers a low-cost early warning system for UAS detection and classification consisting of a BladeRF software-defined radio (SDR), wideband antenna and a Raspberry Pi 4 producing an edge node with a cost of under USD 540. The experiments showed that the Raspberry Pi using TensorFlow is capable of running a CNN feature extractor and machine learning classifier as part of an early warning system for UASs. Inference times ranged from 15 to 28 s for two-class UAS detection and 18 to 28 s for UAS type classification, suggesting that for systems that require timely results the Raspberry Pi would be better suited to act as a repeater of the raw SDR data, enabling the processing to be carried out on a higher powered central control unit. However, an early warning system would likely fuse multiple sensors. These experiments showed the RF machine learning classifier capable of running on a low-cost Raspberry Pi 4, which produced overall accuracy for a two-class detection system at 100% and 90.9% for UAS type classification on the UASs tested. The contribution of this research is a starting point for the consideration of low-cost early warning systems for UAS classification using machine learning, an SDR and Raspberry Pi. © 2022 by the authors.","NA","convolutional neural network; deep learning; interference; machine learning classification; rf spectrum analysis; signal analysis; transfer learning; uas detection; unmanned aerial systems; unmanned aerial vehicles","NA","Aerosp.","0","2.514","120","NA","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","0","0","0","0","41"

Peaberries are not considered defective, but separating peaberries is important to make the shapes of the remaining beans uniform for roasting evenly. The separation of peaberries and normal coffee beans increases the value of both peaberries and normal coffee beans in the market. However, it is difficult to sort peaberries from normal beans using existing commercial sorting machines because of their similarities. In previous studies, we have shown the availability of image processing and machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and k-nearest-neighbors (KNNs), for the classification of peaberries and normal beans using a powerful desktop PC. As the next step, assuming the use of our system in the least developed countries, this study was performed to examine their implementation in and the limitations of Raspberry Pi 3. To improve the performance, we modified the CNN architecture from our previous studies. As a result, we found that the CNN model outperformed both linear SVM and KNN on the use of Raspberry Pi 3. For instance, the trained CNN could classify approximately 13.77 coffee bean images per second with 98.19% accuracy of the classification with 64*64 pixel color images on Raspberry Pi 3. There were limitations of Raspberry Pi 3 for linear SVM and KNN on the use of large image sizes because of the system's small RAM size. Generally, the linear SVM and KNN were faster than the CNN with small image sizes, but we could not obtain better results with both the linear SVM and KNN than the CNN in terms of the classification accuracy. Our results suggest that the combination of the CNN and Raspberry Pi 3 holds the promise of inexpensive peaberries and a normal bean sorting system for the least developed countries. © 2022. the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

When landslide is detected SMS text messages are transmitted using a GSM modem. Due to video camera and Raspberry Pi, this method is inexpensive yet efficient and also requires low power, therefore this method can be used in any region. We have used median filtering to remove noise present in the detection algorithm. Here we have also proposed a new implementation method for median filtering using a linked list and parallel processing which is very time efficient. © 2019 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; cameras; entropy; image processing; landslides; median filters; passive filters; video cameras; background subtraction; computer vision algorithms; continuous monitoring; landslide monitoring; median filtering; motion detection; surveillance systems; video; computer vision","artificial intelligence; background subtraction; camera; computer vision; entropy; image processing; landslide; median filtering; motion detection; raspberry pi; video","NA","Proc.

Digital image processing with deep learning can help handle diseases in melon plants efficiently. Deep-learning-based object detection has significantly better accuracy than the traditional one. However, the deep-learning-based approach leads to high computational and storage resources consumption. Speed and accuracy become tradeoffs to deal with its implementation on devices with limited computing capabilities like Raspberry Pi. This study comparatively analyzes deep-learning-based object detection algorithm performance implemented on a limited computing device, namely Raspberry Pi. The detected object in this study is melon leaves which are classified into two categories, namely abnormal and normal. The experiment was conducted using Faster R-CNN, Single Shot Multibox Detection (SSD), and YOLOv3. The results showed that Faster R-CNN had the highest mAP (~49 %) that ran ~2.5 seconds for an image but had the highest resource usage. Since accuracy is more important than time complexity in melon leaf detection, Faster R-CNN can be recommended as the best object detection algorithm to implement on Raspberry Pi. However, SSD is a fast algorithm with considerable accuracy for real-time detection. In addition, it had not only fast computational time, but SSD MobileNetV2 also spent the least resource usage. Although YOLOv3 had a significantly better running time (0.5 s) which made YOLOv3 the fastest algorithm, it had too low mAP (below 20%). Therefore, YOLOv3 is not recommended for melon leaf abnormality detection since it can allow more detection errors to occur © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License","NA","faster r-cnn; melon; object detection; raspberry pi; ssd; yolov3","NA","Int.

In this manner, this paper shows the use of some artificial neurons to generate chaotic binary sequences whose randomness is enhanced by post-processing approaches and measured by performing statistical NIST SP 800-22 tests. The chaotic neurons are synchronized by different methods and each neuron is implemented on a Raspberry Pi, which allows connectivity to a machine-to-machine (M2M) broker. This wireless connectivity advantage is exploited herein to develop a lightweight cryptographic application under the message queueing telemetry transport (MQTT) for Internet of Things (IoT) protocol. The synchronized neurons have a topology in which one Raspberry Pi works as publisher and can send encrypted information to multiple subscribers. Due to the chaotic behavior of the neurons, the Raspberry Pi acting as subscriber can recover the encrypted information if and only if it has the right key, i.e., the correct random binary sequence generated by the publisher. To augment the security against attacks, the chaotic neurons have different initial conditions before M2M synchronization is accomplished, and the color image encryption under MQTT for IoT is evaluated by performing correlation, histogram, variance, entropy, and NPCR tests. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","binary sequences; cryptography; embedded systems; neurons; synchronization; wi-fi; artificial neurons; chaotic behaviour; chaotic neurons; chaotics; encrypted informations; its applications; message queueing telemetry transport for internet of thing; random binary sequences; raspberry pi; secure image transmission; internet of things","artificial neuron; chaos; mqtt for iot; random binary sequence; raspberry pi; synchronization","NA","Nonlinear Dyn","17","1.262","127","116","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","1","1","0","17","18"

Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect's face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer's uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in accurate detection of faces compared to state-of-the-art face detection and recognition methods, and verify its effectiveness for enhancing law-enforcement services in smart cities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","fire fighting equipment; law enforcement; learning systems; smart city; support vector machines; video signal processing; face detection and recognition; face recognition systems; face recognition technologies; investigation process; law-enforcement agencies; multimedia; prioritization; video processing; face recognition","face recognition; image prioritization; iot and smart cities; machine learning; multimedia; video processing","NA","Future Gener Comput Syst","99","2.233","134","601-650","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","0","0","4","95","54"

Reflectivity is one of the difficulties in distinguishing a duplicate hologram from an authentic one. Due to the fact that a little change in lighting situation would entirely alter the hologram's reflection pattern, a standardized detector for duplicate holograms has not yet been developed. In this work, hyperspectral imaging (HSI)-based housing module for distinguishing between authentic and counterfeit holograms was presented. The module included a Raspberry Pi 4 CPU, a Raspberry Pi camera, an LCD display, and an LED lighting system with a dimmer. A visible HSI algorithm capable of transforming a Raspberry Pi camera's RGB picture into a hyperspectral image was developed. Mean gray value (MGV) and reflectivity measurements were performed on an area of interest (ROI) extracted from the spectral picture. Results indicated that shorter wavelengths are optimal for distinguishing holograms when using MGV as the classification criterion, but longer wavelengths are optimal when utilizing reflectivity. This design is distinguished by its cheap cost, simplicity, absence of moving components, and lack of need for an extra decoding key.  © 2022 IEEE.","cameras; hyperspectral imaging; image segmentation; lighting; liquid crystal displays; lithography; reflection; grey values; hyperspectral imagers; hyperspectral imaging algorithms; low-costs; mean gray value; portable modules; raspberry pi; region-of-interest; regions of interest; security holograms; holograms","holograms; hyperspectral imaging; mean gray value; raspberry pi; region of interest","NA","Int.

The attained information/records are sent as an input to the raspberry pi which uses a computer vision (open CV) software to detect the objects and faces as positive and negative. The corresponding coding is done using python. If any mismatched objects or face (negative) is detected, automatically a signal is sent from the pi module. The desired signal is sent to the authority or monitoring room using transmitter. At one end, the Raspberry-pi module is connected with a monitor, transmitter and at the other end, a receiver with Arduino and buzzer. When any signal is received by a receiver, it is passed to the Arduino, which in turn triggers the buzzer connected to the Arduino and gives an alert signal or sound as it was programmed.

Instrumentation for DCS includes a correlation device that computes the temporal intensity autocorrelation of a coherent laser source after it has undergone diffuse scattering through a turbid medium. Typically, the signal acquisition and its autocorrelation are performed by a correlation board. These boards have dedicated hardware to acquire and compute intensity autocorrelations of rapidly varying input signal and usually are quite expensive. Here we show that a Raspberry Pi minicomputer can acquire and store a rapidly varying time-signal with high fidelity. We show that this signal collected by a Raspberry Pi device can be processed numerically to yield intensity autocorrelations well suited for DCS applications. DCS measurements made using the Raspberry Pi device were compared to those acquired using a commercial hardware autocorrelation board to investigate the stability, performance, and accuracy of the data acquired in controlled experiments. This paper represents a first step toward lowering the instrumentation cost of a DCS system and may offer the potential to make DCS become more widely used in biomedical applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","fourier analysis; humans; logic; male; minicomputers; pulse; regional blood flow; spectrum analysis; transistors, electronic; young adult; blood; coherent scattering; hardware; hemodynamics; medical applications; optical correlation; signal processing; speckle; biomedical applications; blood flow; diffuse correlation spectroscopy; high-frequency sampling; intensity autocorrelation; laser speckle; non- invasive measurements; optical spectroscopy; blood flow; fourier analysis; human; logic; male; minicomputer; procedures; pulse rate; spectroscopy; transistor; young adult; autocorrelation","blood flow; coherent scattering; laser speckle; optical spectroscopy; raspberry pi; software autocorrelation","26274961","Sensors","12","NA","NA","342","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","0","1","3","9","60"

The quality of milk for dairy cows needs to be maintained because milk naturally experiences relatively rapid decay. Protein content can be used as a parameter used to determine the quality of milk. One method used to analyze protein content of milk is by using a spectrophotometer. Technically, a spectrophotometer in a laboratory serves to measure the transmittance or absorbance of a sample expressed in a wavelength function. The wavelength of a sample varies according to the color of the spectrum used. To test protein content, a biuret spectrophotometry method is used which produces purple in the sample, so that the wavelength with the highest absorbance value is found in the range of 525 nm. The absorbance value of the tested samples of dairy cow milk shows the quantity of protein content. The spectrophotometer system is designed using image processing based methods equipped with Raspberry Pi. Tests were carried out by comparing protein content between standard laboratory spectrophotometers and proposed Raspberry Pi based spectrophotometers. The comparison results obtained from Raspberry Pi based spectrophotometer tests have an average error of 2.366%. The classification of the quality of milk for dairy cows produces 3 levels of classification, namely milk for dairy cows with a protein content of 0% - 2.5% indicating low quality, 2.51% - 7.38% indicating medium quality and 7.39% - 9.63% indicating high quality. © 2019 IEEE.","image processing; meteorological instruments; proteins; spectrophotometers; absorbance values; average errors; comparison result; dairy cow; high quality; low qualities; protein contents; spectrophotometry methods; dairies","dairy cow milk; protein; raspberry pi; spectrophotometer","NA","Proc. - Int.

It is an invention of University of Technology Malaysia (UTM) since 2009 for the blind people to recite Quran through the Braille system. However, current architecture of eBraille Quran comprises of too many modular components, numerous microcontrollers and complexly designed. Another vital issue is that its architecture still uses old technologies where the firmware updating or data correction process cannot be done remotely. This makes it hard to maintain, repair, costly and time consuming. This study proposed an enhancement of current architecture with the latest technology of single board computer named Raspberry Pi 3B+. The architecture is first designed according to the existing features of the eBraille Quran. Then, a prototype circuit is developed and fabricated for testing purposes of the proposed architecture. Once the circuit is fabricated, an experiment is conducted to test on how well the new architecture manages the intended functionalities, controlling input and output of braille cells, the performance of start-up time and battery consumption. The result shows that the proposed architecture using Raspberry Pi manages to carry out all the proposed functionalities of eBraille Quran. The start-up time is also within tolerable level with only 1 second slower than the current architecture. Battery consumption on the other hand shows that using Raspberry Pi reduces the battery consumption by 1.2% per hour. ©BEIESP.","NA","architecture; braille system; ebraille al-quran; raspberry pi; single-board computer","NA","Int.

CCSDS-MHC algorithm along with the full prediction mode is opted due to its best compression ratio (CR) performance. The issue of Hyperspectral Image Compression is the loss of data when compress, thus CCSDS algorithm is used in this research. Besides, with current technologies that require low-power but high-performance devices, Raspberry Pi was chosen to be tested in terms of its performances while being compared to other platforms. AVIRIS (airborne) and Hyperion (spaceborne) are used to test the performance of the system. OpenMP is introduced to simplify the computational operation through parallelization to take advantage of the multi-core architecture of the hardware system. In term of execution time, CCSDS-MHC algorithm when parallelize using OpenMP gave the best performances about 69.4% for AVIRIS 1997 dataset, 69.3% for AVIRIS 2006 dataset and 67.7% for Hyperion dataset. The execution time of performance CCSDS-MHC in Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ comparing with other different multicore platform is validate and the mean parallelize is measured. The result of comparison proves that faster performing task gives the best result due to higher speed of CPU-cores performances. From this research, it is proven that Raspberry Pi which is a low-power embedded platform able to compress the hyperspectral images at optimized speed with the implementation of OpenMP through CCSDS algorithm. Therefore, this research will be useful for further studies in lossless of hyperspectral images. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","NA","NA","NA","IOP Conf. Ser. Mater. Sci.

Classification of fruits by visual inspection is an arduous, time-consuming process and prone to human error. The machine vision system is a distributed control system that integrates several machine vision modules with a control module and a user interface unit. This research proposes a method for recognising and sorting tomato fruits into a preferred location continuously. Before designing colour sorter the physical properties of fruits were studied. The major and minor diameter of the tomatoes ranges from 45-60mm and 35-50mm, respectively. The mean geometric diameter, sphericity and surface area were 48.64mm,0.94 and 6477.14mm2 respectively. The average length, width, thickness, bulk density and true density were 54.63mm, 48.44mm, 51.42mm, 0.6874g/cm3, 0.9852g/cm3, respectively. The colour sorter was researched, designed and created with Raspberry Pi, USB camera, servo motor and different digital as well as mechanical components. The model used for Raspberry Pi is Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, USB camera with a video resolution of 640 x 480, 4.2-6V servo motor. Image evaluation is completed on each captured picture and Raspberry Pi will do the selection of which fruit can be sorted. Specific programming code in Python is written for this system. The developed colour sorter captures images and diverts fruits into the respective channel at the rate of 1800 fruits/h (i.e.one fruit per 2 seconds). © 2022, National Institute of Science Communication and Policy Research.

With the plenty of manufacturers and the latest technologies, the usage of home automation is up to the mark. Firstly, from a social point of view, human care is very essential for physically challenged and elderly people. Secondly, it is implemented using a single Raspberry Pi controller. The controller controls and monitors many home appliances that are interconnected to form a home network. For example, the home appliances such as lights, Fans, temperature and humidity sensors, gas leakage detectors, smoke detectors, and fire detectors can be controlled by a single controller. It also includes the establishment of security and emergency alert systems in case of an emergency. So, this leads to an idea to develop a smart home controlling system for physically challenged people. The system developed must be low cost, low power consumption, cheaper, cost-effective, flexible and it should be user-friendly interface, same as the usage of the remote control of various electronic gadgets in our day-to-day life. It should be designed as user-friendly, so that the person can use it very easily and effectively same as, other hand-held devices. In this paper, a smartly controlling system was developed especially for physically challenged and elderly people. This was done by integrating Raspberry Pi and various sensors into the web applications. To design this system, a Raspberry Pi module along with a voice control technique is used. The output of this system is to control home appliances. All the home appliances are simply controlled by connecting through a monitor built on the internet. Raspberry Pi is used to operate and controls the motion sensors and voice recognition for controlling the home appliance through human voice to provide the smart home.

This paper also describes how biometrics can leverage cloud's boundless computational resources and striking properties of exibility, scalability, and cost reduction in order to reduce the cost of the biometrics system requirements of different computational resources (i.e. processing power or data storage) and to enhance the performance of biometrics systems' processes (i.e. biometric matching). Here, Raspberry Pi is used to build a low-cost biometric system. Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a credit-sized mini-computer with great capabilities similar to a PC. In this study it is used as a remote enrollment node. The application of Raspberry Pi and cloud computing has given a new direction of research into the field of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Using the biometric technology, a new system of IoT based biometrics is proposed. To maintain the security of biometric traits over the Internet channel from RPi client to the cloud, cryptographic algorithms are applied like RSA and enhanced AES-256.

To do so, we set up two different testbeds scenarios and assessed the performance with benchmarks. At the software level, we focused on Mosquitto, a popular open-source MQTT broker implementation and client library. Our principal metric is the transmission time, but we also investigated the throughput. In our experiments, we varied several parameters, such as the size of the payload of the published messages, the WiFi bandwidth, the QoS level, the security level (MQTT vs. MQTT with TLS), and the hardware for the clients and broker. We focus mainly on packet sizes ranging from 100 to 25,000 bytes. We also investigate how these low-cost devices handle a TCP SYN flood attack. In the research work presented within this paper, we aim to guide developers, researchers, network administrators, and hobbyists who plan to use these low-cost devices in an MQTT or IoT network by showing the performance that they should expect according to different Raspberry Pi options © 2022.

In this study a shopper-follower robot was developed to lessen the effort of shoppers especially in grocery areas or supermarkets. The Raspberry Pi-Based Shopping Cart Following Robot uses Raspberry Pi microcomputer which serves as the brain of the system where every module is connected and Python is the programming language that is used for the system. It has a barcode scanner that allows the shopper to scan products and provide an initial bill. The ultrasonic sensor determines the distance between the front side of the shopping cart whether if it is in the waiting state or follow state; it uses Arduino as a connection from its output to the inputs of the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ to eliminate delays of direct connection to Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Another ultrasonic sensor can be found on both sides of the shopping cart to determine obstacles that will be avoided by the shopping cart. The load cell sensor is also used to determine the weight of the products/ items in the shopping cart; it uses the Arduino IDE to develop algorithms that can be used to calibrate weight measurements. The buzzer will serve as the alarm if the weight of the shopping cart reaches above the given maximum weight. The buzzer will also alarm once the shopping cart loses contact with the shopper; the shopping cart has a maximum allowable distance of one (1) meter to the shopper. Also, the robot was equipped with webcam so that it can follow a shopper through computer vision-based algorithm and object tracking. By having several trials, the object tracking method that is used is the Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking (CSRT), for it is much capable of determining the shopping cart's owner throughout the duration time of shopping. As a result, the Raspberry Pi-Based Shopping Cart Following Robot functions well and had performed its intended operation.  © 2022 IEEE.","computer vision; microcomputers; retail stores; robots; scanning; tracking (position); ultrasonic sensors; arduino ide; design and development; follower robots; images processing; object tracking; raspberry pi 3 b+; robot technology; shopping carts; tracking method; vision tracking; machine design","arduino ide; image processing; object tracking; raspberry pi 3 b+","NA","IEEE Reg. 10 Symp., TENSYMP","0","NA","NA","NA","Scopus","raspberry pi","0","0","1","1","0","0","28"

The well-known Raspberry Pi board is used as platform to exploit the different proposed concepts. SciPy, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries, which are Python-based open-source libraries for scientiffc computing and graphical representation, are used to perform Matlab-like simulations and to implement classical control loops. On the other hand, virtual processes developed in Easy Java Simulations are adapted to be controlled through the network from a controller implemented on the Raspberry Pi with Python. This option is very useful from a teaching point of view since time-based, networked-based, or event-based control approaches can be easily introduced on this proposed architecture. Furthermore, once students know how to implement control loops on the Raspberry Pi using Python, external real processes can be easily controlled by using the GPIO interface available in the this electronic board. Then, a project based on these tools and ideas is motivated and presented in this paper to control a two-tank level process. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

In the first case, we used the Turtlebot to generate an indoor map of the robotic lab room using the Gmapping ROS packet. In the second case, we used the robot to create 3D models for the surrounding objects in the room. We used the Raspberry Pi 3 as a replacement of the laptop that was used to control the Turtlebot. The same implementation of the first and second tasks have been repeated to compare the performance. The Raspberry Pi accomplishes the given tasks successfully; however, there is some delay due to the different on the CPU power.

This paper presents a novel Audio guidance system for blind in the shape of simple bag with earphone for giving them an audio guidance efficiently and safety. Different with other audio guidance, we propose a simple system consist of Raspberry Pi Camera and Ultrasonic Sensor as input, Raspberry Pi, Earphone and Power bank. This system is initiated by providing a voice command of the direction where the blind person must walk or go through, so they can avoid from obstacles. We also apply Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to detect the obstacles along they walk by using 3 ultrasonic sensors. The experimental result shows that by using FLC and interfacing by Raspberry Pi the proposed system can effectively to detect the obstacles and give direction with 2.32% distance error. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","computer circuits; data visualization; earphones; electronic guidance systems; remote control; ultrasonic applications; ultrasonic sensors; assistive devices; design prototype; fuzzy logic controllers; guidance system; simple system; statistical datas; visually impaired; voice command; fuzzy logic","NA","NA","J.

Bilateral filter is used for reducing various noises especially Additive White Gaussian Noise which occur more in standard test images. The important feature of this nonlinear bilateral filter is the preservation of the edges, while reducing the noise in the images. The main idea is to replace the pixel’s intensity value by a weighted average of adjacent pixel intensity value. Euclidean distance and radiometric differences of pixels, are used for weight calculation. This calculation mainly preserves sharp edges by looping through each pixel and adjusting weights to the nearest pixel values. Our project aims to reduce cost and power consumption using Raspberry pi. It consists of series of microcomputer packed onto a single circuit board. These low power computers are mass produced at very low prices. The performance of Raspberry pi is equivalent to a personal computer. In order to perform noise reduction in Raspberry pi, python2 and opencv package is installed in real-time Raspbian Linux operating system and algorithm is executed using python2 programming language.

To achieve constriction and dilation, bright LEDs of White, Red, Green and Blue wavelengths are Turned ON and OFF respectively, at rapid rate, while the tracking is going on. The saccade velocity assessment is done by showing a rapidly moving pattern between 2 points. Thus, by obtaining these ranges for the patient and comparing them with a pre-calibrated diabetes proneness scale, the patient's proneness to diabetes and also an accurate measure of his/her Visual Acuity is obtained.

Based on the reported statistics for 2016, a total of 7152 people died due to road accidents in Malaysia, and these accidents are often caused by human errors. Efforts to curb these accidents include increasing patrols by authorities and joint campaigns involving transport authorities and police but these efforts are not long-term as they only focus around accident hotspots nationwide. The Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) aims to assist drivers and to increase car safety, not only through improving driving experience but also through taking into consideration the overall passenger safety. In recent years, driver’s drowsiness has been one of the major causes of road accidents, resulting in severe physical injuries and deaths, resulting in significant economic loss. In this paper, a vision-based real-time driver alert system, aimed mainly to monitor the driver’s drowsiness condition and distraction condition, is proposed. The real-time driver alert system consists of (1) a drowsiness warning system in the Driver Drowsiness Monitoring System (DDMS) module, and, (2) a Raspberry Pi development board, a camera, two LEDs, and a buzzer in the Raspberry Pi Deployment (RPD) module. The DDMS module focus on monitoring the driver’s condition in a quad-step method: (1) detecting driver’s face, (2) detecting eyes region, a (3) estimating the rate of eyes closure, i.e. drowsiness level, and (4) estimating the head pose, i.e. inattentiveness in driver, in order to monitor the driver’s condition. The RPD module focus on (1) embedding the DDMS system into the Raspberry Pi, mounted with a Raspberry Pi camera with a buzzer, to capture the driver’s condition, and (2) mounting the system in the car, to alert the driver by providing a medium loud beeping sound. Experimental results show that proposed system is practical and low-cost which could (1) embed the real-time drowsiness detection module, and (2) provide alert notification to the driver when the driver is inattentive, using a medium loud beeping sound, in real-time. © 2019, ECTI Association.

The idea is to keep the whole system in the standby mode except for the low power motion sensor. On the detection of an event, when a person enters and originates a motion, the front-end embedded processor is alarmed. Afterwards, it activates the remaining system modules like webcam, communication block, etc. The event-driven feature improves the system performance in terms of resources utilization and power consumption compared to the counter classical ones. A first system implementation is realized and successfully tested. It is based on a raspberry pi 3 board, which is integrated with two Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors and two webcams. On the occurrence of an event the webcam is activated and it captures an image. The image is recorded via the Raspberry Pi webcam server and is shared with other system modules via the Porta Space application, which acts as a hub between the Raspberry Pi and the cloud. Simultaneously the attendance status is updated via the IFTTT on the cloud-based log. Moreover, the concerned authorities are notified via an email. The process is repeated every time when a person enters or leaves the concerned place. The attendance log remains globally available via the cloud and can be accessed anytime. The system design flow is described. The devised system functionality is tested with an experimental setup.

This results in computational-related learning being very limited and minimally taught to students. The widespread use of ICT tools in indirect learning has changed the way students interact with content. This paper presents a different approach, while keeping the teacher at the centre of control of classroom activities but students are given the opportunity to explore the content to be learned by CS-Unplugged and Raspberry Pi. This activity aims to provide basic knowledge about how computers work. One of the activities is a simulation and experimentation on how computers work through the CS Unplugged approach. The basic knowledge formed from the simulation was then used as the basis for assembling a simple computer using Raspberry Pi. Based on the results of observations and interviews conducted, the utilization of CS Unplugged provides a learning experience that builds on the initial concept of how computers work. This is shown by an increase in students' motivation and enthusiasm in learning how the computer works. This experience is what then makes it easy for students to do various computer assembly experiments using Raspberry Pi. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","computer programming; education computing; engineering education; classroom activity; computer work; ict-tools; indirect learning; learning experiences; students","NA","NA","J.

In 2012, Ebon Upton started the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which introduced the Raspberry Pi (RPi) as a $35 basic computer. The goal was to reignite public interest in programming and increase enrollment in college computer science. Today, the third RPi iteration features a multicore processor, a small GPU for display graphics, WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity. Surprisingly, even though the RPi has become very popular with the public and college students for do-it-yourself projects and maker culture, instructors have not widely used it to teach operating systems concepts. In this paper, I share my experience using the RPi in my Operating Systems class. The paper makes the following contributions: • Pedagogical advantages of using the RPi over other traditional and cloud-based methods to teach operating systems concepts • Challenges for the instructor and students running many RPis in a classroom setting over the campus enterprise network. • Advantages of using the RPi to stimulate student creativity and motivate them to design and implement their own related computing projects. © 2017 IEEE.","computer operating systems; computer programming; iterative methods; multicore programming; teaching; classroom settings; computing projects; design and implements; enterprise networks; multi-core processor; pedagogy; raspberry pi; student motivation; students","operating systems; pedagogy; raspberry pi; student motivation and learning","NA","Proc.

However, human checking of trap contents is expensive, and in many environments, the pest species most frequently encountered in the traps can be detected and monitored automatically. To achieve this goal, a dedicated data acquisition device is necessary, which makes real-time and online pest monitoring possible from a distant location. In addition, it is beneficial for the device to run machine learning algorithms that count and identify insects automatically from pictures. Thanks to the advantages of integrated circuits, more systems have been designed to improve integrated pest management in the context of precision agriculture. However, in our opinion, all of those systems have one or more disadvantages, such as high cost, low power autonomy, low picture quality, a WIFI coverage requirement, intensive human control, and poor software support. Therefore, the aim of this work is to present a novel plug-in board for automatic pest detection and counting. The plug-in board is dedicated to Raspberry Pi devices, especially the Raspberry Pi Zero. The proposed board, in combination with a Raspberry Pi device and a Pi camera, overcomes the limitations of other prototypes found in the literature.

The performance, which is a measure is the time and memory used to encrypt and decrypt with the same key-the method used in research with an experimental approach. Where experimental done on Raspberry PI with PHP programming language, the results of this study indicate that the AES algorithm requires a shorter time in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm uses a larger memory capacity in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm is recommended to use because in terms of security AES has a more significant number of keys that is 128 bits while the DES algorithm has a key length of 64 bits or half of the number of keys in the AES Algorithm.

The allocation of resources for putting one together is a complex issue, given the factors that have to be coordinated: hardware, software, infrastructure, administration, and ethics. Costs may be significant and cost-effective solutions are desirable. Methods: We chose Medical Imaging Resource Center (MIRC) to build our teaching file. It is offered by RSNA for free. For the hardware, we chose the Raspberry Pi, developed by the Raspberry Foundation: a small control board developed as a low cost computer for schools also used in alternative projects such as robotics and environmental data collection. Its performance and reliability as a file server were unknown to us. For the operational system, we chose Raspbian, a variant of Debian Linux, along with Apache (web server), MySql (database server) and PHP, which enhance the functionality of the server. A USB hub and an external hard drive completed the setup. Installation of software was smooth. Results: The Raspberry Pi was able to handle very well the task of hosting the teaching file repository for our division. Uptime was logged at 100 %, and loading times were similar to other MIRC sites available online. We setup two servers (one for backup), each costing just below $200.00 including external storage and USB hub. Conclusion: It is feasible to run RSNA’s MIRC off a low-cost control board (Raspberry Pi). Performance and reliability are comparable to full-size servers for the intended purpose of hosting a teaching file within an intranet environment. © 2014, CARS.","computer communication networks; computers; cost-benefit analysis; feasibility studies; humans; radiology; radiology information systems; software; article; computer; cost effectiveness analysis; digital imaging and communications in medicine; feasibility study; imaging software; information processing; medical education; priority journal; radiology; computer; computer network; computer program; cost benefit analysis; education; human; radiology; radiology information system","low-cost; mirc; radiology; raspberry pi; rsna; server; teaching file","25547256","Int.

Four multi-threaded implementations are evaluated. These implementations are Portable Operating System Interface Threads, C++11 threads, Threading Building Blocks, and OpenMP threads. It is demonstrated that the various thread techniques have distinct variations in frequency and shape as EM emanations is leaked from the Raspberry Pi. Additionally, noise is introduced while the cryptographic algorithm executes. The results indicates that tt is still possible to visibly see the execution of the cryptographic algorithm. However, out of 50 occasions the cryptographic execution was not detected 32 times. It was further identified when calculating prime numbers, the cryptographic algorithm becomes hidden.

With the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the field of human behavioral prediction and analysis, especially human emotion, has evolved significantly. The most standard methods of emotion recognition are currently being used in models deployed in remote servers. We believe the reduction in the distance between the input device and the server model can lead us to better efficiency and effectiveness in real life applications. For the same purpose, computational methodologies such as edge computing can be beneficial. It can also encourage time-critical applications that can be implemented in sensitive fields. In this study, we propose a Raspberry-Pi based standalone edge device that can detect real-time facial emotions. Although this edge device can be used in variety of applications where human facial emotions play an important role, this article is mainly crafted using a dataset of employees working in organizations. A Raspberry-Pi-based standalone edge device has been implemented using the Mini-Xception Deep Network because of its computational efficiency in a shorter time compared to other networks. This device has achieved 100% accuracy for detecting faces in real time with 68% accuracy, i.e., higher than the accuracy mentioned in the state-of-the-art with the FER 2013 dataset. Future work will implement a deep network on Raspberry-Pi with an Intel Movidious neural compute stick to reduce the processing time and achieve quick real time implementation of the facial emotion recognition system. © 2021 by the authors.

Raspberry Pi can be used as the main processor for the SID system. It can be easily operated without the need of a personal computer. However, the available sound card are limited and sampling rate is on 48 kHz. This limit the detection of the VLF frequency detection to approximately 22 kHz. Thus it become a limiting factor to view the VLF spectrum in a full range (3-30 kHz).

An evaluation is performed on the EM leakage as the device executes the AES-128 cryptographic algorithm contained in the libcrypto++ library in a threaded environment. Four multi-threaded implementations are evaluated. These implementations are Portable Operating System Interface Threads, C++11 threads, Threading Building Blocks, and OpenMP threads. It is demonstrated that the various thread techniques have distinct variations in frequency and shape as EM emanations are leaked from the Raspberry Pi. It is demonstrated that the AES-128 cryptographic implementation within the libcrypto++ library on a Raspberry Pi is vulnerable to Side Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks. The cryptographic process was seen visibly within the EM spectrum and the data for this process was extracted where digital filtering techniques was applied to the signal. The resultant data was utilised in the Differential Electromagnetic Analysis (DEMA) attack and the results revealed 16 sub-keys that are required to recover the full AES-128 secret key. Based on this discovery, this research introduced a multi-threading approach with the utilisation of Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) to serve as a software based countermeasure to mitigate SCA attacks.

However, the built-in wireless network interface card (NIC) adapter fails to support the CB. Thus, we have configured the CB using external NIC adapters, and investigated the throughput performance and estimation model for only one link between a PC host and a Raspberry Pi AP. In this paper, we present the throughput measurement for concurrent communications of multiple links with up to three APs under different adapters and channels with 11 and 13 partially overlapping channels (POCs) at 2.4GHz. Besides, we extend the throughput estimation model by introducing the throughput drop factor to consider interferences between the links.

The system is constructed as follows: firstly, a yellow sticky trap is installed in the surveillance area to trap flying insects and a camera is set up to collect real-time images. Then the detection and coarse counting method based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection, the classification method and fine counting based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) using global features are designed. Finally, the insect counting and recognition system is implemented on Raspberry PI. Six species of flying insects including bee, fly, mosquito, moth, chafer and fruit fly are selected to assess the effectiveness of the system. Compared with the conventional methods, the test results show promising performance. The average counting accuracy is 92.50% and average classifying accuracy is 90.18% on Raspberry PI.

We compare its sound performances with those of a wide variety of materials and configurations. This solution achieves the high timing accuracy and sound quality important in auditory cognition experiments, while being simple to use and open source. The present system shows high performances and results along with excellent feedback from users. It is inexpensive, easy to build, share, and improve on. Working with such low-cost, powerful, and collaborative hardware and software tools allows people to create their own specific, adapted, and shareable system that can be standardized across different collaborative sites, while being extremely simple and robust in use. © 2021.

The surveillance system can travel within the surveillance area, allowing more areas of interest to be viewed with the least amount of surveillance equipment possible on a limited budget. Furthermore, acquiring relevant data becomes much easier than surveillance monitoring is adaptable with numerous sensors like humidity/ digital temperature/ sonic/ air quality/ smoke sensors, etc., that may be used for diverse applications.

Implementation of this scenario needs following topics to be addressed. For controlling and capturing the video, Raspberry provides the console application raspivid which can be executed with parameters specifying how the video shall be captured. You can specify parameters like width, height or frames per seconds as if the video be produced to a file to out. The service application implemented in this example internally uses the raspivid. For video capturing the service starts raspivid and then reads incoming video data from raspivid's out. The service executes raspivid with above specified parameters. Live video data continuously coming from raspivid's out needs to be transferred across the network to the connected client. To transfer the data for inter-process communication the implementation uses the lightweight cross-platform library. The communication is based directly on duplex channels to avoid serialization or deserialization. It means the service application running on Raspberry Pi uses input duplex channel and the.NET client running on PC as output channel. When a raspivid's out provides chunk of video data, the service uses the duplex channels to send data to connected clients. Then it uses output channel to receive the video data and to notify it for further processing. © 2016 IEEE.","integrated circuits; putty; video recording; video streaming; cross-platform; frames per seconds; interprocess communication; live video; output channels; raspivid; service applications; video capturing; video signal processing","putty; raspberry pi; raspivid; video streaming","NA","Proc.

With their impressive computation and communication capabilities and low footprint,these devices have thrown open the possibility of realizing a network of things in a very cost-effective manner. While such networks offer good solutions to prominent issues,they are indeed a long way from being smart or intelligent. Most of the currently available implementations of such a network of devices involve a centralized cloud-based server that contributes to making the necessary intelligent decisions,leaving these devices fairly underutilized. Though this paradigm provides for an easy and rapid solution,they have limited scalability,are less robust and at times prove to be expensive. In this paper,we introduce the concept of Agents on Raspberry Pi (AgPi) as a cyber solution to enhance the smartness and flexibility of such embedded networks of physical devices in a decentralized manner. The use of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) running on Raspberry Pis aids agents,both static and mobile,to govern the various activities within the network. Agents can act autonomously or on behalf of a human user and can collaborate,learn,adapt and act,thus contributing to embedded intelligence. This paper describes how Tartarus,a multi-agent platform,embedded on Raspberry Pis that constitute a network,can bring the best out of the system.

So far, there are various methods involving identity verification in mobile application development, yet, it was still considered challenging and have been a primary study due to its limitation to memory allocation and the computing power. Subsequently, to address these issues there are different algorithms that were designed for identity verification to adopt the mobile environment and to resolve the arising challenges. In this paper, we proposed a novel, cost-effective and energy-efficient framework by introducing a mobile-based identity verification on offline-mode using the Raspberry Pi framework. A Raspberry Pi device is wirelessly connected to mobile phone to process the face detection and face verification. The proposed method is implemented on the latest version of Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ version run in Python 3.7 where the datasets and training sets images were experimented and tested using LBP algorithms for face detection and face verification. With the experimental test result using the confusion matrix in a multiclass classification, the proposed method showed a results of 87.5% accuracy score, 88% in terms of precision, 88% recall score and 86% F1 score. In addition, the experimental test were done using 3000 images in a controlled/unconstrained environment, were 20% or 600 of the images were used as data sets. During the offline mode testing, the face detection and verification has resulted to an average timing of 4.98 seconds. Thus, it concludes the feasibility to implement face verification system in the Philippine government services such as the voting system, road check-point, driver's ID verification to name a few. © 2019 Kohat University of Science and Technology.

These applications suffer from slower decision-making due to network delays, less availability of bandwidth, transmission delays, processing delays, and data de-noising. To avoid this, Fog computing can be applied as a middle layer between the IoT and Cloud layers. Here, to understand the Fog computing and its characteristics applications along with its advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. Fog computing greatly reduces transmission delays, but Fog devices lag in computing capabilities due to their limited processing power. This can be solved by deploying multiple devices and synchronizing their computation to enable parallel execution. In this paper, a single Raspberry Pi is used as a Fog node and multiple such Raspberry Pis are deployed in the cluster form. The Dispy Python framework is used to allow parallel processing. Scalability is easy to achieve with Dispy, and also it provides different features like automated node discovery, job distribution, processing function distribution, remote access, and enhanced security. The system is proposed and implemented to test the hypothesis that it improves the real-time computation in health care applications. The final results are compared with a traditional processing system and it is found that the Raspberry PI cluster, and Dispy can enhance the computation performance in Health Care © 2020 IEEE.","cluster computing; decision making; distribution functions; fog; health care; internet of things; cloud computing technologies; computation performance; computing capability; computing environments; health care application; internet of things (iot); real-time computations; traditional processing; fog computing","decision making; dispy; distributed computing; ecg analytics; fog computing; parallel processing; raspberry pi cluster","NA","Proc.

It compares two or more biometric data to identify the differences among them properly. Based on the comparison between individual's biometric features and stored authorized features, it makes the decision of matched or mismatched. If the given sample of the biometric data matches with the stored one, authorization is confirmed. Nowadays, many real-time applications use biometric authentication to meet security purposes fully. However, it is difficult to implement fingerprint recognition system specially on Linux based computer. A well-known, less costly embedded computer called Raspberry Pi is used to build the entire system. Fingerprint enrollment, fingerprint recognition, photo capture, QR code generation as well as QR code reading were entirely done using python and python associated libraries. For storage management, we have used MySQL as it is convenient and open-source. This paper discusses about a quality authentication model which is highly capable and cost- effective. The authentication process consists of extracting the biometric features with ORB algorithm, matching those features using FLANN matcher, generating and validating QR code based on encrypted personal information accurately. Here, AES algorithm is used for encrypting personal data which is then converted and stored in form of QR code. Final authentication process involves both fingerprint and QR code validation.

Driven by a distributed embedded system architecture, each of the devices can work on independent local data, which is device specific, to perform similar compute tasks simultaneously so a common goal can be achieved. This collaborative problem solving in the embedded setting is similar in concept to the big data paradigm now commonly proposed for commodity hardware and large databases. As the embedded devices become more capable and powerful the two concepts will combine. However, they are currently worlds apart, and thus forms the motivation of our research. In this project, a middleware layer is developed and tested to make the devices work collaboratively on local data within a network of Raspberry Pi devices.

Rather than by using specialised equipment for sequential measurements, this can be achieved by using several low-cost measuring devices on vehicles that travel on the road network as part of their daily assignments. The presented work proves the hypothesis that a low cost measuring device can be built and can provide measurement results comparable to those obtained from expensive specialised measuring devices. As a proof of concept, two copies of a prototype device, based on the Raspberry Pi single-board computer, have been developed, built and tested. They use accelerometers to measure vehicle braking deceleration and include a global positioning receiver for obtaining the geolocation of each test. They run custom-developed data acquisition software on the Linux operating system and provide automatic measurement data transfer to a server. The operation is controlled by an intuitive user interface consisting of two illuminated physical pushbuttons. The results show that for braking tests and friction coefficient measurements the developed prototypes compare favourably to a widely used professional vehicle performance computer. © 2019 by the authors.

One of the tests that are used to assess these motor deficits is the tapered beam test, which provides a sensitive measure of bilateral motor function based on foot faults (slips) made by a rodent traversing a gradually narrowing beam. However, manual frame-by-frame scoring of video recordings is necessary to obtain test results, which is time-consuming and prone to human rater bias. New method We present a cost-effective method for automated touch sensing in the tapered beam test. Capacitive touch sensors detect foot faults onto the beam through a layer of conductive paint, and results are processed and stored on a Raspberry Pi computer. Results Automated touch sensing using this method achieved high sensitivity (96.2%) as compared to ‘gold standard’ manual video scoring. Furthermore, it provided a reliable measure of lateralized motor deficits in mice with unilateral photothrombotic stroke: results indicated an increased number of contralesional foot faults for up to 6 days after ischemia. Comparison with existing method The automated adaptation of the tapered beam test produces results immediately after each trial, without the need for labor-intensive post-hoc video scoring. It also increases objectivity of the data as it requires less experimenter involvement during analysis. Conclusions Automated touch sensing may provide a useful adaptation to the existing tapered beam test in mice, while the simplicity of the hardware lends itself to potential further adaptations to related behavioral tests. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","analysis of variance; animals; automation, laboratory; biomechanical phenomena; disease models, animal; equipment design; female; foot; male; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; motor activity; pattern recognition, automated; random allocation; software; stroke; touch; polyurethan; animal experiment; animal model; article; automation; behavior; camera; cerebrovascular accident; computer; cost effectiveness analysis; electrode; false negative result; false positive result; female; foot fault; ischemia; male; motor dysfunction; motor function test; mouse; nonhuman; parameters; predictive value; priority journal; reliability; sensitivity analysis; sensor; software; tapered beam test; touch; videorecording; analysis of variance; animal; automated pattern recognition; biomechanics; c57bl mouse; devices; disease model; equipment design; foot; laboratory automation; motor activity; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; randomization","automation; behavior; mouse; raspberry pi; stroke; tapered beam test","28860079","J.

An evaluation is performed on the EM leakage as the device executes the AES-128 cryptographic algorithm contained in the libcrypto++ library in a threaded environment. Four multi-threaded implementations are evaluated. These implementations are Portable Operating System Interface Threads, C++11 threads, Threading Building Blocks, and OpenMP threads. It is demonstrated that the various thread techniques have distinct variations in frequency and shape as EM emanations are leaked from the Raspberry Pi. It is demonstrated that the AES-128 cryptographic implementation within the libcrypto++ library on a Raspberry Pi is vulnerable to Side Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks. The cryptographic process was seen visibly within the EM spectrum and the data for this process was extracted where digital filtering techniques was applied to the signal. The resultant data was utilised in the Differential Electromagnetic Analysis (DEMA) attack and the results revealed 16 sub-keys that are required to recover the full AES-128 secret key.

There is a huge growth in technology connected to almost every field. The pace and diversity of advancement is very rapid. Hence, new technology and techniques are coming up and are put to use as per the need. In such advanced scenario, providing security to home has also become a major point of concern. Presently security cameras can be used for the same. But such cameras may be visible to intruders and there is possibility that cameras may be damaged. Hence, in order to serve the purpose, there is a need to find an alternative secure, accurate and quick method. Hence, an effort is made in this paper to design a home security system using Raspberry Pi. System requires Raspberry Pi, Camera, Touch screen and android mobile as hardware components. Python, Node.js and OpenCV libraries are used for software coding. Usually most of the intrusion detection systems click the photo of intruders as soon as the human is detected. But, such systems fail to click photos, so that the intruder can be identified (Face View Photo) and visible. In proposed system, a proper illustrative method is proposed so that the intrusion detection is accurate and photos thus captured are clear, so that intruder is clearly visible. The proposed system is designed as a smart mirror which will provide both information and home security. The system is developed to accept touch and mobile commands. As soon as the intrusion is detected, an alert message along with the identifiable and clear photo (Face view) of intruder will be sent to the owner's/administrator's mobile. The mirror owner can also see the video of deployed environment through the camera fitted on smart mirror. © 2020 The Authors.

In this research paper along with the designing and comparison, two small SCADA systems for agricultural applications tries to reduce the size as well as address a zonal method to investigate the security problems. Till these days' researchers have shown lots of development to reduce the SCADA cost in different manner but, having the compact, powerful and small size host for SCADA system has not been reported before. One of the novel aspects in this design is hiring the Raspberry Pi as the smallest computer instead of PC or laptop which along with reducing the system cost can also reduce the whole design system. Besides, Web based SCADA system has been successfully designed here and used. This paper discusses the context of local as well as remote monitoring of an agricultural plant environment with the help of a Raspberry Pi network through which a SCADA System was established. This paper aims to prove that a far more efficient and cost-effective along a secure SCADA System for monitoring is possible with the lowest of efforts. So, having zonal idea will help system to achieve the aim of secure sensor monitoring without any kind of outside interference. The result shows the successful design and implementation of zonal idea as well as the perfect usage of Raspberry Pi as a small and reliable host. © 2019 IEEE.","agricultural robots; agriculture; cost effectiveness; cost reduction; distributed database systems; distributed parameter control systems; scada systems; agricultural plants; dcs(distributed control system); design and implementations; remote monitoring; security challenges; security problems; sensor monitoring; supervisory control and data acquisition; monitoring","agriculture; arduino; esp. module; internet of things (iot); raspberry pi; web database; zonal web-based scada","NA","Proc. - Int.

However, available methods for bacterial detection are still not ready for in-field screening because culture is time-consuming; PCR requires complex DNA extraction and ELISA lacks sensitivity. In this study, a microfluidic biosensor was developed for rapid, sensitive and automatic detection of Salmonella using metal-organic framework (MOF) NH2-MIL-101(Fe) with mimic peroxidase activity to amplify biological signal and Raspberry Pi with self-developed App to analyze color image. First, the target bacteria were separated and concentrated with the immune magnetic nanobeads (MNBs), and labeled with the immune MOFs to form MNB-Salmonella-MOF complexes. Then, the complexes were used to catalyze colorless o-phenylenediamine and H2O2 to produce yellow 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). Finally, the image of the catalysate was collected under the narrow-band blue light and analyzed using the Raspberry Pi App to determine the bacterial concentration. The experimental results showed that this biosensor was able to detect Salmonella Typhimurium from 1.5 × 101 to 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL in 1 h with the lower detection limit of 14 CFU/mL. The mean recovery for Salmonella in spiked chicken meats was ~112%.

This paper presents a novel idea to develop a controlling unit using Raspberry Pi that can be connected to a TV or computer LCD monitor through VGA or HDMI port to convert it into a smart mosque (masjid) display. The smart masjid display is capable of displaying the prayer times, date, day, time and temperature. The prayer time schedule can be set and calculated based on the GPS coordinates of the place or the city. Moreover, it differs than the traditional dot matrix Masjid displays since it can display from time to time several Islamic prayers (Adzkar) of morning and evening, and audible and visual announcements as pictures and videos. Furthermore, the Imam of mosque, especially in the Taraweeh prayers, can display the pages of the Holy Quran on the smart display instead of carrying the Holy Quran by hand. The developed smart masjid display can be remotely controlled using a remote controller wearable as a ring on the finger of user/Imam which allows him to remotely flip the Quran's pages presented on the display even during the prayers.

To increase the access and affordability of chromatographic data acquisition, especially for systems in which software control has become obsolete or must be written in-house, an open-source digital stripchart recorder has been developed. This system is built upon a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and a plug-in printed circuit board with the necessary integrated circuits for data acquisition. Using an open-source software called Processing, a complete user interface to control the system was developed that enables the acquisition, filtering, and processing of chromatographic data.

According to Ericsson, by 2020, there will be 50 billion connected devices which is seven times the total world population. So the acquisition and utilization of such data from the environment and building Energy consumption for creating a better Monitoring System will always be a challenge in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) and big data analytics. So it is very much important to implement an effective and low cost Building Monitoring System to understand more about the building environment and energy utilization in order to take automatic adaptive decisions for better Energy consumption in the upcoming future. The overall objective of this paper is to utilize Raspberry Pi as a Key component of Building Monitoring System to Monitor the environmental parameters viz., Temperature, Barometric Pressure, humidity, Light etc and also to monitor the power consumption of the building environment in order to develop an effective environmental monitoring system which can be properly utilized in performing data analytics for Energy harvesting in the future. © 2017 The Authors.

The sudden increase in the Internet population and manifold growth in internet speeds has occasioned the generation of an enormous amount of data, now termed 'big data'. Given this scenario, storage of data on local servers or a personal computer is an issue, which can be resolved by utilizing cloud computing. At present, there are several cloud computing service providers available to resolve the big data issues. This paper establishes a framework that builds Hadoop clusters on the new single-board computer (SBC) Mobile Raspberry Pi. Moreover, these clusters offer facilities for storage as well as computing. Besides the fact that the regular data centers require large amounts of energy for operation, they also need cooling equipment and occupy prime real estate. However, this energy consumption scenario and the physical space constraints can be solved by employing a Mobile Raspberry Pi with Hadoop clusters that provides a cost-effective, low-power, high-speed solution along with micro-data center support for big data. Hadoop provides the required modules for the distributed processing of big data by deploying map-reduce programming approaches. In this work, the performance of SBC clusters and a single computer were compared. It can be observed from the experimental data that the SBC clusters exemplify superior performance to a single computer, by around 20%. Furthermore, the cluster processing speed for large volumes of data can be enhanced by escalating the number of SBC nodes. Data storage is accomplished by using a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which offers more flexibility and greater scalability than a single computer system. © 2018 KIPS.","cloud computing; cost effectiveness; data handling; digital storage; distributed database systems; energy utilization; file organization; green computing; personal computers; population statistics; supercomputers; clusters; hadoop; map-reduce; raspberry pi; single board computers; big data","clusters; hadoop; mapreduce; mobile raspberry pi; single-board computer","NA","J.

The Complementary filter neglects the error by combining the gyroscope and accelerometer values to get accurate values. As soon as the controller is moved in a specific direction the sensor sends a signal to the server. Then the Raspberry Pi which is connected to a wireless network reads the signals by the controller and sends them to simulator. Subsequently, the simulator generates a specific angle and position so that the direction and the speed can be controlled. When using a handheld controller, the user must have some previous knowledge of the device. Normal controllers have an excessive number of configurations, which can be challenging.

Among all the SDCs available nowadays, Raspberry Pi devices constitute maybe the most renowned representatives. On the other hand, the wavelet transform plays an important role in contemporary standards for image compression (such as JPEG-2000) and video compression (MPEG-4). In this work, we present and evaluate three parallelization strategies of the 3D fast wavelet transform (3D-FWT) on a cluster of Raspberry Pi 2 SDCs. Each parallelization strategy has been implemented using both POSIX Threads (shared memory) and MPI (message passing). The set of implementations using POSIX Threads is restricted to runs on a single board, whereas multiple boards can be used for the MPI versions. We find out that noticeable speed-ups can be obtained when all MPI processes or POSIX Threads are run using the cores of a single Raspberry Pi 2 SDC. However, in the case of the MPI versions, we observe that performance drops drastically when all MPI processes spread to several boards. The reason for this is the limited bandwidth that the onboard LAN port can deliver, and that proves insufficient for the fine-grained, high-volume communication requirements of the studied parallelization strategies. Finally, we have also considered the execution of the POSIX Threads and MPI versions on a very high-performance but power-hungry 4-core Intel Xeon CPU E5606, obtaining that the Raspberry Pi 2 SDC can do the task with much lower total energy consumption (up to 4 times). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","energy utilization; message passing; motion picture experts group standards; wavelet transforms; fast wavelet transform; general-purpose single-board computing (sdc); parallelization strategies; posix threads; raspberry pi 2; speed up; image compression","3d fast wavelet transform (3d-fwt); general-purpose single-board computing (sdc); mpi; parallelization strategies; posix threads; raspberry pi 2; speed-up","NA","J Supercomput","8","0.727","68","801-1000","WOS","raspberry pi","0","0","1","1","0","8","46"

All of these tools enable the deployment of various state-of-the-art DNN models for inference, though each one relies on particular optimization libraries and techniques resulting in different performance behavior. In this paper, we present a comparative study of some of these frameworks in terms of power consumption, throughput and precision for some of the most popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. The benchmarking system is Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, a low-cost embedded platform with limited resources. We highlight the advantages and limitations associated with the practical use of the analyzed frameworks. Some guidelines are provided for suitable selection of a specific tool according to prescribed application requirements. © 2018 SPIE.

The number of times the subject blinks will be taken into account for identification of the subject's drowsiness. Also the direction of where the user is looking will be estimated according to the location of the user's eye gaze.

As a consequence, many cryptographic techniques are used to assure network security. Cryptography makes use of two techniques: symmetric-key and asymmetric-key cryptography. However, specific concerns remain. In this paper, a hybrid security algorithm is proposed. It provides both high security and fast encryption and decryption processes by using symmetric-key and asymmetric-key techniques. In addition, it provides three cryptographic primitives: confidentiality, authentication, and integrity. The concept is to encrypt using Blowfish, Rivest Cipher 4, and the Advanced Encryption Standard. Message Digest 5 is used for integrity, and Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman is used for authentication. Two computers and a Raspberry Pi test the proposed algorithm's performance. The proposed algorithm exceeds numerous current algorithms in ciphertext size, encryption time, decryption time, and throughput. Using a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and a plaintext size of 184,162 bytes, the proposed algorithm achieved a 37% reduction in ciphertext size, a 90.5% reduction in encryption time, a 62.7% reduction in decryption time, and a 1052% increase in throughput compared to previously published works.  © 2022 IEEE.","authentication; data privacy; network security; wireless sensor networks; % reductions; ciphertexts; cryptographic techniques; decryption time; diehard; hybrid algorithms; raspberry pi; security; symmetric keys; wsn; cryptography","cryptography; diehard; hybrid algorithm; raspberry pi; security; wsn","NA","Proc.

In such an operation, the panel voltage–power curve has a unique global maximum power (GMP) to be tracked. Therefore, this paper proposes a new maximum power point tracker (MPPT) implemented by Raspberry Pi 4-based embedded board programmed via two metaheuristic approaches of cuckoo search (CS) and particle swarm optimizer (PSO). The approaches are developed using python software programming language to adapt the duty cycle fed to the MOSFET of DC/DC boost converter connected to the panel terminals. The panel is simulated in Simulink/Matlab library to identify the GMP in each studied case. An experimental setup is conducted in the lab room of the college of Engineering, Jouf University, Saudi Arabia to assess the proposed tracker. Moreover, eight shade patterns are considered via covering 10% to 80% with step 10% of panel with shadow. Furthermore, statistical tests of the Wilcoxson sign rank test and ANOVA are conducted to assess the validity of the proposed tracker. The obtained results are compared to perturb and observe (P&O) and gray​ wolf optimizer (GWO). The PSO-based tracker achieved the best efficiency of 96.92%, the CS achieved 93.62%, and GWO get an efficiency of 93.15%. Additionally, on the side of Wilcoxson sign rank and ANOVA tests, the PSO outperformed CS and GWO.

FoamPi is an open-source Raspberry Pi device for monitoring polyurethane foaming reactions. The device effectively monitors temperature rise, change in foam height as well as changes in the mass during the reaction. Three Python scripts are also presented. The first logs raw data during the reaction. The second corrects temperature data such that it can be used in adiabatic temperature rise reactions for calculating isocyanate conversion; additionally this script reduces noise in all the data and removes erroneous readings. The final script extracts important information from the corrected data such as maximum temperature change and maximum height change as well as the time to reach these points.

There are several dehazing techniques proposed to resolve the haze in the outdoor images but the existing techniques suffers from the computational time complexity. For a real-time application time complexity plays a major role. As a part of real-time application haze removal is done using the raspberry pi b+v1.2. The hazy image is restored by taking dark channel with patch size of 11 × 11 to avoid the oversaturation of recovered scene radiance and halo effect. Getting the image size and channels, the image is flattened to get the top bright points. Then the image is padded at the ends with a square of side of the window to get the minimum comparision at the ends. Because the atmospheric light to be taken from the foreground as the background has almost same pixel values distributed. The intensity is found, from that maximum among these pixels are found and considered for atmospheric light. The transmission map is found, hazy image is restored.

The proposed module is divided into two, one is static object detection which uses Threshold value matching, SURF feature extraction for obstacle matching and Bivariate gaussian mixture model for high dimensional bivariate features extracted and later to convert the obtained visual information into the audio information using a raspberry-pi setup. Secondly the system deals with the dynamic obstacles too for which employs Gaussian mixture distribution in modeling background of each pixel and an on-line approximation to update the model. The moving human region is detected by background subtraction. The shadow detection and elimination are implemented in the HSV space, and finally morphological operations are introduced to eliminate noise and reconstruct moving human regions. The results show that the method models stable background, eliminates shadow, and has a good detection result. This algorithm detects the shape of the object and searches from the database provided in the hardware and converts the textual information to an audio information. The audio information is given in-terms of a vibration which protects the eardrum and also helps as a hearing aid for the partial hearing loss people.

When the system recognizes a change in motion (human motion) compared to its previous frame, the system starts recording video and stores it primarily in its memory and also in the cloud (for the reason that even if the burglar tries to destroy the system his image/video will be saved in the cloud storage), and the user receives alert mail from the system stating “human motion detected” along with the captured image attached with the alert mail. The system contains database of face patterns of local suspects which is compared with the face pattern of the person triggering the system, and image processing is done in real time to correctly identify the detected face; the system also keeps tracking the face throughout the region even if the person moves out of the frame by a camera mounted over a servo motor. The system turns on a buzzer alarm when the burglar attempts to cause damage to the system. The system allows the user to remotely access the camera to monitor live streaming video output and control the rotation of the camera. Methods/Statistical analysis: In this project, different types of surveillance systems which already exist are analysed, and the methods of having a portable surveillance system were developed using Raspberry Pi. Image processing methods for facial identification and face recognition is used. Findings: A study based on various image processing techniques is done; it is found that Haar-cascade and linear binary pattern are the suitable algorithm for performing image processing in real time. Application/Improvements: For better surveillance, face tracking in introduced, which can track the detected face throughout the region even if the person goes out of the camera frame, and remote accessing with control of the camera through IoT is introduced. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","cameras; embedded systems; face recognition; image recording; internet of things; monitoring; processing; video streaming; camera modules; face matching; face tracking; monitor and control; raspberry pi; security systems","camera module; cloud upload; face matching; face tracking; iot monitor and control; raspberry pi","NA","Lect.
